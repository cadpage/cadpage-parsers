* Cadpage not alerting on Samsung device
**************************************************************************
Another user resolved a similar issue on a Samsung device by adding
Cadpage and the Cadpage Message support app to a list of unmonitored
apps in battery settings.  This seems to be something unique to Samsung
devices, I do not have any such settings on my stock Google devices.

Open your main android settings and select
Device Maintenance > Battery > Unmonitored apps
Then add the Cadpage and the Cadpage Message Support apps.

Good luck,
-Ken
**************************************************************************
OK, this gets a bit complicated.

First question.  When you say that you are not receiving text messages, do you mean they are not showing up in your message app at aoo, or that they are showing up but Cadpage is not picking them up.  If they are not showing up in your message app, then you need to talk to someone in your department about getting them sent to your phone.

Most likely they are showing up in your message app but Cadpage is not picking them up.  It is not doing that because you have disabled Cadpage message support.  To turn on Cadpage message support, open Cadpage Location settings and change the "Message Type Processed" setting to include SMS and/or MMS messages, which you are currently receiving.

This where things get complicated.  You have installed the latest Cadpage release from which the critical bits of Cadpage SMS/MMS message processing have been removed.  Those important bits have been moved into a new Cadpage message support app that has to be downloaded and installed from our web site.  As soon as you enabled Cadpage message processing, Cadpage will detect that the you do not have that support app installed and pop up a window that will give you two choices
1) Turn off Cadpage message processing, or
2) Install the message support app.

This window should have been displayed when you first installed the latest Cadpage release and you probably picked the first option.  Which would explain how Cadpage message processing got to be disabled now.   You need to pick the second option which will take you to a web page that explains how to download and install the message support app.

All of this complicated stuff is necessary because Google has decided that apps distributed through their play store will no longer be allowed to access incoming text messages.  This all lets me continue to distribute Cadpage and it's updates through their Play Store while continuing to process text messages.

Sorry for the extra complicatedness,
-Ken
**************************************************************************
No active email address

You do have a current Cadpage subscription that expires on____________. Cadpage did not find it because it because you have not given Cadpage permission to use your email account information, which it needs to find  subscriptions on our backup authorization server.

To fix that, open Cadpage General Settings, select "Billing Account" and then select the jay1629@gmail.com account.

Then select
Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

That should restore your paid subscription status.

Thanks for your support,
-Ken


**************************************************************************
No email address - wanting to pay with check


Before I tell you about our payment options, please note the following:

You presumably do have a configured email address, but you have not
granted Cadpage permission to access your account information.  Without
that access, Cadpage does not know who you are and can not confirm
whether or not you have a subscription.

If you use the Google Play Store payment option mentioned in my next email, you do not need to do anything about that.

If you decide to send a check via SNAIL mail, then you will need to do the following:

Cadpage needs the GET_ACCOUNTS permission to process your subscription request.
It would have prompted you to grant this
permission the first time you tried to send us a support email or
recalculate your payment status.  But if you declined that request, and
checked the "Never ask again" box, you will never again be prompted to
grant be permission.  If this is the case, the only way to fix things is
to open the main Android settings and select
Apps > Cadpage > Permissions
then enable the "Contact" permission.

Details on payment options are in the next email.


**************************************************************************
* Not receiving runs/ calls, pages
**************************************************************************

Are dispatch alerts showing up in your message app?  If not then you need to talk to someone in your department about getting their alerts sent to you.

If they are, can you use the "Email the Developer" setting to send us a new support email right after Cadpage fails to pick up an alert?

**************************************************************************
* MMS support enabled but not working
**************************************************************************

Dispatch is sending your alerts as MMS multi-media messages instead of the simpler SMS text messages.  You do have Cadpage MMS message support enabled, but it does not appear to be working properly.  This is not uncommon, Cadpage MMS support has always been a bit dodgy.

Since you are paying for a Cadpage subscription, you might want to consider switching to using the Cadpage Paging Service to deliver your alerts.  This will send alerts to your phone through the data network, avoiding all of the hassles involved with text messaging.  It would also leave you positioned to avoid the fallout if Google carries through with plans to prohibit Cadpage from processing text messages on March 9.

To start the paging service, open Cadpage Settings and select:

    Direct Paging Venders > Cadpage Paging Service > Register

You should shortly receive a registration confirmation popup that will display your dispatch email address. From there you will have the option to generate an email requesting that your dispatch alerts be sent to this address. Then fill in the address of your department IT person and send it.  Any alerts sent to that dispatch address will be automatically forwarded to Cadpage on your device.

If you would rather pursue getting Cadpage MMS processing to work, you need to look through your message app setting looking for something that tells it to always download MMS message content.  With the current Google Messages app, this  is done by opening Settings, selecting Advanced Settings, then turning on the "Auto Download MMS" option.  Other message apps should have a similar setting somewhere.

If you are using a different message app, let us know what it is so I can check and make sure I can get Cadpage to work with it.  Unless it is Verizon messenger which appears to have gone out of it's way to make sure that Cadpage does not get it's MMS message notifications.  With Verizon Messenger, we recommend uninstalling or disabling the app and installing a different message app.

Good luck,
-Ken

* Android Anti-virus rant
**************************************************************************

OK, time for my Android anti-virus soapbox rant.

As pretty much any Android developer will tell you, Android anti-virus products are a waste of time and money.   They are sold to people who grew up with Windows desktops.  Windows has absolutely no internal security, malicious apps can access pretty much anything, as can the anti-virus software that is looking for them.  In that environment, good anti-virus software is an absolute necessity.

The Android environment is an entirely different animal.  All applications are locked in secure little sandboxes where they can not access anything really dangerous.  And cannot access anything that might be problematic with requesting specific permission to do so.  That both limits the amount of damage a malicious app can do, and severely restricts how much the so-called anti-virus software can do to detect them.  About all they can do is examine the permissions other apps have requested and warn you when they request something that looks suspicious.  Something you can do quite well yourself when you first install and app and again by later its permission list in the app manager.

There are malicious apps out there, but if you restrict yourself to installing apps from Google Play Store, and ask serious questions about why apps needs permissions that seem unnecessary you can do a pretty good job of protecting yourself.  Anti-theft software and can remotely lock your phone and track its location when it wanders away is a valuable resource.  For the technically inclined willing root your phone, a firewall app that controls exactly which other apps are permitted to access the Internet can be invaluable.  But an anti-virus app that lacks root access (which they all do) is completely useless.

Thanks for listening,
-Ken

Cadpage Paging Service

Cadpage now has a very simple direct paging service.  When you register with this service Cadpage assigns you a unique dispatch email address. It is up to you to get your dispatch alerts sent to this email address. Alerts sent to this address will be forwarded to Cadpage as direct pages.

To start the paging service, open Cadpage Settings and select:

    Direct Paging Venders > Cadpage Paging Service > Register

You should shortly receive a registration confirmation popup that will display your dispatch email address. From there you will have the option to generate an email requesting that your dispatch alerts be sent to this address. Then fill in the address of your department IT person and send it.

This paging service is only available to users or departments that have current paid Cadpage subscriptions. Each device running this service generates expenses that Cadpage must cover.

We especially appreciate the 200+ early adopters with lifetime subscriptions that supported Cadpage at the start. Those members are encouraged to use this paging service as part of their initial investment.

Thank you all for your continued support!

**************************************************************************
NO FREE PAGING SERVICE

You can only register for the paging service if you have really paid for
a subscription.  We have to pay the server operators for each device
using that service and cannot afford to do that for users who are not
paying us.

**************************************************************************
Benefits of using Cadpage Paging Service

Direct paging is a way to push dispatch alerts to Cadpage without
relying on text messaging.  The advantages of doing this are

1) If/when you upgrade to Android 4.4, Cadpage will no longer be able
to block text alerts from showing up in your message inbox.  There are
workarounds for this, but using direct paging bypasses the entire problem.

2) Most Android tablets do not have the ability to receive text
messages.  Direct paging is the only way you can make Cadpage work on them.

3) Long dispatch messages have to be truncated or split into multiple
text messages to get around length restrictions on text messages.
Direct paging is not subject to those limits.

4) Direct paging avoids any fees or charges carriers impose on text messages.

If you are not having any of these problems, there is no reason why you
shouldn't continue using text dispatching.  Sooner or later, you will likely
have to upgrade to an Android 4.4 phone and run into the message inbox problem.
But until then, you can keep on doing what you are doing now.

And the Cadpage paging service is free if you have a paid Cadpage
subscription, so why not try it!

Thanks for your inquiry!
Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

* New National Weather Service location
***************************************************************************

We did recently add a National Weather Service location.  Like all other locations, specifying it does not result in alerts being sent to your device.  It only tells Cadpage how to process alerts that you arrange to have sent to your device.  If you, or your department, have arranged to have NWS alerts sent to your device, specifying the NWS location, in addition to your regular location, will result in Cadpage formatting and displaying those alerts in a little better format than the standard General Alert.  If not, then it really will not do anything for you.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

This has been reported, it appears to be a recent bug in the copy/paste clipboard infrastructure introduced in Android 4.3 and fixed in Android 4.4.  The ConvertIt app and possibly other clipboard monitoring apps have been implicated.  If you have any of those installed, I would try uninstalling them.

Thanks for reporting it,

***************************************************************************
* Android 4.4 (Kit Kat) dispatch pages showing up in message app inbox
***************************************************************************

Google permanently removed the capability of apps blocking text messages from getting to the default message app starting with Android 4.4.  They had some good reasons for doing so, that feature was being abused by regular message apps blocking calls to competing messaging apps.  But it left Cadpage like apps that really have a legitimate reason to block text messages in a lurch.  There was a movement to request Google restore that capability in some future version of Android, but that seems increasing unlikely.

While it is no longer possible for Cadpage to prevent dispatch alerts from getting to the message app inbox, there are some workaround that can be used to alleviate the issue.

If you are a paid subscriber, you can try our new Cadpage paging service.  This will assign you a personal dispatch email address.  If you can have your dispatch alerts sent to this email address, they will be pushed to your phone through the mobile data network.  No text messaging is involved, so there is no problem with the text alerts showing up in our message app inbox.

To start the paging service, open Cadpage Settings and select:
    Direct Paging Venders > Cadpage Paging Service > Register

You should shortly receive a registration confirmation popup that will display your dispatch email address. From there you will have the option to generate an email requesting that your dispatch alerts be sent to this address. Then fill in the address of your department IT person and send it.

Another alternative would be to use the spam blocking or blacklisting features of your message app to block messages sent from dispatch.

You can also use a new "Alert Delay" setting in Notification Settings to delay the Cadpage alert notification by a few seconds.  If your message app is also sounding an audio alert, delaying the Cadpage alert so that it happens after the message app alerts prevents it from being silenced by the message app alert.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

****************************************************************************
Effect of 4.4:

It just means that text alerts that you get
from Dispatch will show up in your message inbox as well as triggering
Cadpage.

****************************************************************************
Not a PAID subscriber but has 4.4

The extra text messages are a "feature" of the new Android 4.4 system.  There are some good reasons why Google made that change, but the bottom line is, Cadpage can no longer block dispatch text alerts from showing up in your message inbox.

If you were a paid subscriber, you could try our new Cadpage paging service.   You can only register for the paging service if you have really paid for a subscription.  We have to pay the server operators for each device using that service and cannot afford to do that for users who are not paying us.

Another alternative would be to use the spam blocking or blacklisting features of your message app to block messages sent from dispatch.

In the long run, there is an open enhancement request
https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=61684
asking Google to restore third party message blocking functionality in some future version of Android.  Feel free to register your opinion there.

If you are having other difficulties with Cadpage, please let us know.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

* Registration switched to Active911 app
***************************************************************************

It looks like you installed and registered the Active911 app on your device.  That redirects alerts away from Cadpage to the Active911 app.  You can restore Cadpage operations by registering it with Active911 servers.  To do that, go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
Then enter the same activation code you used to register the Active911 app (___________).

Once you register Cadpage with the Active911 servers, you should be able to use both the Cadpage and Active911 apps to process the same calls.  Details on how this works can be found at

* AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
* Cadpage triggered bugreport dump
***************************************************************************

This is a Google problem that they do not have a solution for yet.  Something about the October release of the Google Play Services is breaking GCM registration for a very small number of users running Gingerbread phones.  It looks like happen to be one of those unlucky few.

The latest version of Cadpage does have some extra logic to help Google identify the source of this problem.  That logic has been tripped on your phone and created a file on your SD card that needs to be emailed to us so I can forward it to the Google engineer working on this problem.  The simplest way to do that is probably to connect your phone to a PC as a disk and copy the file Download/bugreport.cadpage.gz from your phone SD card to the PC and then include in an email to ken@cadpage.org.

Actual fixes or workarounds are still elusive.  Google recommends a factory reset.  But they say going in to the Application Manager, finding the "Google Services Framework" app and clearing both the cache and data *MAY* help.  They prefer the factory reset, but I won't tell if you try the clear data first.  In any case, let me know how things work out.

I would check to see if a system update is available.  Open Android Settings and select
About Device > Software Update > Check Updates
If there is a system update available for your phone, it will get you beyond the version of Android where this problem occurs.

If there is no update available, and you happen to have a Verizon phone, you can try calling tech support and complaining that your phone has no upgrade path to Android 4.0 and critical software apps cannot run on the old version you have.  Sounds like a long shot, but the first user I had run into this got Verizon to replace his phone by doing that.

Good luck
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
* bugreport filed - what now???
***************************************************************************

Big disclaimer, the following instructions are NOT recommended by the Google engineers.  There recommendation is to do a factory reset.  The following procedures might clear up the problem without doing a factory reset.  But they also might disable your phone to the point where you will have to do a factory reset to recover it.  To my mind, it isn't much of a risk, especially since Google seems to be in no hurry come up with a better fix.

I haven't run a Gingerbread phone for a while.  If I remember correctly, you go into the main Android settinsg menu and select
Applications > Manage Applications
and display the "All" tab.

Scroll down this list until you find Google Service Frameworks.  Select it and press the force stop, clear data, and clear cache buttons.  Then open Cadpage and try to register it with CodeMessaging again.  If it works, terrific.

If it doesn't, try restarting the phone.

If it still doesn't work, go back into the All Applications list and do the the Force Close, Clear Data, Clear Cache thing on
Google Service Frameworks
Google Play Service
Google Play Store
Power down your phone and then restart it
Open the Google Play Store and use it to browse a few things to see if it is working.  Open it's account setting and make sure you have an account selected.

Then try to register Cadpage with CodeMessaging again.

If it still doesn't work, you are down to doing a factory reset :(

So far, the factory reset has only failed to fix the problem one time.  And that user resolved the problem by getting Verizon to ship him a new phone.  If your problem persists after a factory reset, Google very much wants to talk to you.

Alternate solution I should have mentioned before, but in case I haven't

See if a system update is available for you phone.  From what I remember you get there by going back to Android Settings and selecting
About Phone > Software Update > Check for Updates.

If there is no system update available, and you got the phone from Verizon, you can try calling Verizon support and complaining that the phone can not be upgraded and the current software can not run critically needed software.  That is how my first user got Verizon to ship them a new phone.

Take care,

***************************************************************************
* AUTHENTICATION_FAILURE
* No triggered bugreport dump
***************************************************************************

I just released a new v1.6.46 version of Cadpage which should be available on Google Play Store shortly.  It has some additional logging logic to record a whole bunch of information that I hope will be helpful to the Google people working on this.  I need you to trigger that log logic and send us the resulting file.  More specifically,

Make sure that you have v1.6.46 or later of Cadpage installed.

You will need to install some kind of file manager.  Astro file manager is highly recommended and has a useful free version.

Try, again, to register with Active911 direct paging again.  Since I haven't done anything that might possibly fix things, this will, presumably, fail again.  This will trigger creation of a bugreport file, but the process takes a long time, give it a good 5  min before proceeding to the next step.

Use the Email the Developer setting to generate another email to us.  While this message is open, find a way to attach a file to it.  With Gmail, you would do this by pressing the menu button, attach a picture or video, then select the previously installed file manager to select the file.

In the file manager, navigate to the Download folder on your SD card.  Exactly where this is differs from phone to phone.  The SD card might be  mounted as /sdcard or /sdcard0 or /storage/sdcard0.  Where ever it is, it should have a Download folder, which hopefully will contain a file named bugreport.cadpage.gz.  Long press that file and select it, confirm that that file has been attached to your email and send it.

Do you recall just what it was you were doing when this crash happened?

***************************************************************************
* Receiving CodeMessaging text pages
***************************************************************************

Short answer: you are getting text pages from CodeMessaging and probably want to switch that to getting direct pages.

To do that, go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct paging Vendors > CodeMessaging.net > Register
and follow the directions.

Long technical answer:  CodeMessaging has been switching to a new model where they run the Cadpage text parsers on their servers and send the page information in a standard Cadpage defined page format that is in no way related to the page format dispatch uses to send the original page information.  If you try to process their text pages using the standard Harford, MD location, it will not work.  That location code expects the pages to be formated the way Harford dispatch sends them, which is no longer the case.  It will work if you go into Location Settings and set the location to
Select Single Location > General Location > Standard Cadpage Format A

But, life gets so much simpler for all concerned if you switch to using direct paging, which handles all of these details.

Take care,
-Ken

*****************************************************************************

Click the "Yes" button under "Do you currently receive messages from
CodeMessaging.net".
Enter your email address and phone number and click "Submit"
CodeMessage should send you an email with a 4 digit validation code.
Enter this validation code and click validate.
This should take you to your profile page with a list of configured
devices.  Make sure the entry labeled "CADpage Direct" is enabled and
will receive CAD Dispatches.  Then click the "Finish" button.


******************************************************************

Handcent is the culprit.  They insist on being the top dog in the SMS queue, meaning they control whether Cadpage gets to see SMS text pages rather than the other way around.

Actually it is more complicated that that.  Cadpage, Handcent, and Go SMS are all fighting for the top slot, and the Android system awards that prize to the one that was installed first.  So you will find it starts working when you install a new version of Handcent, and stops working when you install a new version of Cadpage.  Which always makes it look like our Cadpage update broke things.

So what can you do, there are a few choices:
1) The latest version of Handcent has a new option to lower the input priority.  Presumably this will make it compatible with Cadpage, but this has not been conclusively confirmed.To get to it, select
   Menu > Settings > Application Settings > Lower Priority
2) You can uninstall Handcent and look for another messaging app, preferably after sending them a polite note telling them you won't put up with apps that don't play nicely with Cadpage.
3) You use the Handcent settings to blacklist the email/phone number dispatch uses to send you pages.  Then it nicely drops those calls back to Cadpage.
4) You can go to our download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/ where we keep the most recent version of Handcent that plays nicely with Cadpage.  Install that and things should work nicely.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************

OK, let's try this:  Go to Cadpage Settings > General Settings > Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status, then immediately scroll to the bottom of the menu and select Email the Developer to send us an email from Cadpage.

This will send us an email to confirm what your Cadpage User email address is, as well as lots of other information to help us solve this.

******************************************************************

Direct paging is a cool feature that lets selected messaging services push CAD pages to Cadpage without using SMS text messaging.
Which means,
1) No SMS text message charges
2) No SMS text message size limits
3) It works on Android tablets

It only works if you are getting messages from a cooperating message service, which currently means either CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com.  CodeMessaging will only work with departments. Active911 works for departments or individuals.

Cadpage does not expect subscription payments if you are registered to get direct pages from one of these agencies.  We get part of they money you pay them.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
Active911 explanation
******************************************************************

Active911 is a messaging service that can push pages from dispatch to cell phones.  If you use a plain cell phone, Active911 uses text messaging.  If you use Cadpage or an iphone, Active911 can push pages without using text messages.

******************************************************************

You or your department have apparently paid for Active911, but you need to re-register your phone with Active911 to enable direct paging.

Here are the details. If you have your activation code of letters and numbers, jump to step 3 below.

1. First, do you have an account with Active911?  If not, you should contact them about getting set up.  You can do that by visiting their web page at Active911.com.  Click the contact link, then the "click here to sign up online" link in the right sidebar.

2. If someone already set up a device for you, they should give you the device number and activation code you will need.  If you do not have that, Go to their website and open the Member Access page.  Then select the correct department and open the Devices tab.  If there is a device entry for you, it will show the required device number and activation code.  If not, it should tell you who to contact to set one up.  The device type needs to be set to Smartphone and the Page Type to "Cadpage Direct (Android)"  Make a note of the Device Key (or Access Code) associated with the device.

3. Next open the Cadpage settings on your phone.  Select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This takes you to a web page where you need to enter the two part Device Key / Access code associated with the device.  If all goes well, Cadpage will display a notice that your Active911 direct paging connection has been activated.

At this point, Active911 will start sending you pages through the Internet data network instead of using SMS text pages.

Please let me know if you still have problems with Cadpage.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

******************************************************************
** Already has activation code or switch to Android with Active911
******************************************************************

Your department has apparently paid for Active911, but you need to register your phone to enable direct paging with Cadpage.

Open the Cadpage settings on your phone.  Select Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register

This takes you to a web page where you need to enter the two-part device code.

Your device code is:

If all goes well, Cadpage will display a notice that your Active911 direct paging connection has been activated.

At this point, Active911 will start sending you pages through the Internet data network instead of using SMS text pages.

Please let me know if you still have problems with Cadpage or the registration process.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

******************************************************************

You will need the numeric device number and 4 character activation code associated with that device.  This is information you can obtain from your administrator, but let me know if you need assistance with that.


If you have paid for a Cadpage subscription within the last 6 months, I can refund your payment.  With direct paging with Active911, Cadpage is free.


******************************************************************
Trouble registering with Active911  phase 2
******************************************************************

Very occasionally, people are having trouble registering with
Active911.  There are a couple things you can try, usually something works.


*** For Android versions >= 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings
Scroll down to the Account settings and select Google
Verify that the Google Play account is syncing properly (ie.. that the last sync date/time is fairly recent)

*** For Android versions < 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings > Accounts & Sync > Google > Sync
and see if everything synchronizes.

Go into Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > I have an authorization code
and enter a code of "zapit".

Restart the device and try again.

This takes care of 95% of the reported problems.  If it does not there
are some odder tricks that are occasionally required.

Power down your device, remove the SD card, then power it up and
register Cadpage with Active911.  I have no idea why this would make any
difference, but it got one user up and running.

Double check your Active911 device configuration to confirm that it is
configured with a page type of Cadpage (Android).

Take care,
-Ken

**********************************************************************

This could be one of two different problems.

1) the more common one is where your register Cadpage with Active911.  Active911 accepts the registration the confirmation never gets to Cadpage.  As a result, Cadpage does not show that you are registered with Active911 and your payment status does not give you credit for being sponsored by Active911, but you still receive direct pages from Active911.

2) Your Cadpage registration works successfully, Both Active911 and Cadpage report a fully activated status for a time.  But then something happens that unregistered your device on Active911, but not on Cadpage.

Which is your situation?

Take care,
-Ken

**********************************************************************

Q:  I have been unable to get the key and activation code from my admin for
Active911 if you could help me I would greatly appreciate it.

A-- Alas, the Active911 support people have asked us not to do that as a
security precaution.  They want to make sure that anyone registering to
get their pages has department authorization to do so.  And we are not
in any position to validate that.

If you really cannot get the activation code from your admin you should
probably call the Active911 support line and ask them what you can do.

Take care,

Please let me know if you need any updates on your department subscription.

Thanks so much for your support,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

******************************************************************
expired

The only payment record I found with your email address was dated _______, which means your Cadpage subscription officially expired as of _____.  If you have made another payment since then, please provide more details.

You may find it useful to log in to wallet.google.com or paypal.com.  From there you should be able to look up your Cadpage purchase and send us the date, time and transaction ID, and whether it was PayPal or Play Store.

A Cadpage subscription is $9.99 for one year.  As you have likely experienced, Cadpage can be used well past the expiration date if you refrain from updates or phone changes.

Is it possible that you or your department have paid for an account with Active911 or another messaging service?  You will need to register your phone to enable Cadpage. Your department administrator should be able to tell you what service your department is using. Perhaps you have paid for Cadpage For IOS.  We are separate companies.

Please let me know how I can help you successfully continue to use Cadpage.

Thanks for your support,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

Thanks for your PayPal payment!

Unfortunately, your PayPal account is most likely not how Cadpage knows you.

PLEASE follow these instructions:
Go to Cadpage settings> Payment status > Hey, I've already paid for this > Send Email

This will generate an email with the correct email account (usually a gmail account) we need for your registration.

In the meantime, I can give you a 30-day extension.  To get that, go into the Cadpage settings, press the Payment Status item, then the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
is BJRUOODA or bjruooda.    It is a time-sensitive code, and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Department subscription; 30% off

I have registered your department members with a one-year Cadpage subscription.

Their instructions are as follows:
Go to Cadpage Settings > General Settings > Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

I have attached an invoice that reflects the members involved, the term of service and the amount payable.  For ___ subscriptions,
your total cost will be ________________.

inquiry about department sponsorship


Thanks so much for your interest in Cadpage!

I would be delighted to sign up your department with a Cadpage subscription. We offer a 30% discount to departments that sponsor their members. That would be $7 per person per year.  For a department with 25-30 Users, the cost per year would be $175-$210.

Please note that our Cadpage app is exclusively for Android Users.  If anyone in your department is using an iPhone, we would need to discuss other options -- specifically, a messaging service like CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com. Your Android Users can still use Cadpage with those messaging services.   When they register with direct paging, Cadpage is free, since we get some of the funds from that purchase.

If you just have Android Users, I would need the following information to register your department sponsorship: the name of your department, a contact person, which could be you, and a list of your department members' names and phones numbers. It would be easiest if you would send the list in the following format:

First Last (5551234567)
Jean Goul (5551230987)

For payment, I can email or mail you an invoice, with the mailing address for Cadpage. PayPal is another viable option for making a payment.

Please let me know if you have any further questions about Cadpage.

Thanks so much for your interest!
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

******************************************************************
transfer to new phone

Your current Cadpage subscription will transfer easily to a new phone, as long as 2 things are true:
1. Your new phone is still an Android phone
2. Your Cadpage User email address is the same one you used before.

If those are true, then all you need to do after installing Cadpage on your new phone is this:
Go to Cadpage Settings > General Settings > Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

If that fails, please email us again using the Cadpage app.  Go to Settings > General Settings > Email the Developer, and include the configuration information.

Please note, if you have changed your phone number, you will need to contact your Dispatch Center so your text messages can be sent to the correct number.

I noted that your PayPal payment amounted to only $1.00, while a Cadpage subscription is $9.99 per year.  Did you intend to pay for a full subscription?

Thanks for considering the purchase of a Cadpage subscription!  A one-year Cadpage subscription is $9.99.

The usual, and preferred method of purchasing a Cadpage subscription is through the Google Play Store.  You do this by going into the Cadpage Settings and pressing
Payment Status > Purchase through Android Market.  Often you can pay through your phone service at Google Play Store.
Purchases made this way will update your payment status almost immediately.

If that does not work, the web page at
http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments
has  instructions on how to make PayPal or Snail Mail payments

Basically, you can make out a check or money order to Cadpage and mail to:

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your Cadpage User email address (usually a gmail address) so I can make sure you get credit for it.

We would really love to have departments sponsor Cadpage for their members. We offer a 30% discount or more!  Details can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/other-support-options.

Also, if your department uses Active911 or CodeMessaging, then Cadpage is free if you use direct paging.

In the meantime, I can give you a 30-day extension.  To get that, go into the Cadpage settings, press the Payment Status item, then the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
YYUTAAGA or yyutaaga.    It is a time-sensitive code, and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks so much for your support,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

******************************************************************

I am unable to find a Cadpage payment from you. Some details would help me find your account.

How did you pay -- through Google Play Store, PayPal, or by check?  We are unable to search Google Play Store accounts by name; only by email address.  If you paid via PayPal or check, under what name was the payment made?

Have you recently changed your email address?  Most of our accounts are registered with User email addresses.

Approximately when was your last payment?  A Cadpage subscription is $9.99 per year.  Is it possible that your subscription has expired?

It may not be necessary to locate that payment. Go to Cadpage Settings > General Settings > Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status

If that does not work, try logging in to wallet.google.com or paypal.com.  From there you should be able to look up your Cadpage purchase and send us the date, time and transaction ID, and whether it was PayPal or Play Store.

Is it possible that you or your department have paid for an account with Active911, CodeMessaging, or another messaging service?  You will need to register your phone to enable Cadpage. Your department administrator should be able to tell you what service your department is using.

We are very grateful for all contributions and apologize for any complications.

Two different departments dispatched by the same center is easy.  You will get pages for both departments, but they both have to have the same text format, so Cadpage won't have any trouble handling both of them.

The reality is that maintaining and continually developing Cadpage is more than a full time job. We have to pay our bills somehow, and Google takes their fair share.

Most of our Users are volunteer firefighters or EMS workers.  My husband and I are both volunteers with our local fire department. Yes, it is unfortunate that we have to ask people already volunteering so much time and energy to pay us for a cool app.  The reality is that maintaining and continually developing Cadpage is more than a full time job. We have to pay our bills somehow, and Google takes their fair share.

Most of our Users are volunteer firefighters or EMS workers, so our policy for free subscriptions is based on hardship, not on being a volunteer.

To clarify our payment request:
$9.99 per year is way out of line for what you normally expect to pay for a general purpose Android app.  There are two reasons why this is necessary for our Cadpage app.
1) Cadpage is an extremely high maintenance app.  We put out weekly releases, and every week there are usually 10 or so location parsers that have to be fixed, either because Dispatch changed the text format, or because someone found a corner case that wasn't covered by the existing parser.  Most apps get by with a release every 3 months or more.
2) The potential user base is a tiny fraction of what a general purpose app can expect.  Cadpage is a niche market app, appealing to the small number of people who work or volunteer in emergency services.  The same development costs have to be spread among fewer people.

It is unfortunate that we have to ask people already volunteering so much time and energy to pay us for a cool app.  The reality is that maintaining and continually developing Cadpage is more than a full time job. We have to pay our bills somehow, and Google takes their share.

The yearly cost is maintenance for the app. There are dispatch centers out there that change their message formats; upgrades to Google maps; upgrades to Android systems; upgrades to Android phones. Cadpage is an extremely high maintenance app. We put out weekly releases to try and keep up.
Most of
Our policy for free subscriptions is based on hardship, not on being a volunteer.  Both my husband and I are volunteers with our local fire department, so we understand the time, expense and effort involved.

We would really love to have departments sponsor Cadpage for their members.  But we have no way of contacting them, except through staff and volunteers.  We offer departments a 30% discount or more!  Details can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/other-support-options.

In the interest of helping communities, we offer a  number of approved ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.

1) You may request a free subscription, but you have to include a reasonable reason for not being able to afford $9.99 per year.

2) You can simply reinstall Cadpage every 30 days.

3) If you (or your department) are currently using CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as your messaging service, Cadpage is free when you use direct paging.

4) There is an old unsupported version of Cadpage available on the Cadpage download page at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  This version will not bug you about paying for it.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

It is kind of amusing that people think nothing of shelling out $50+ per month for a smartphone carrier plan, but balk at anything more than $2-3 for an app, no matter how useful it might be.

Market problem
******************************************************************

What kind of problem are you having with your Cadpage payment?

The usual, and preferred method of purchasing a Cadpage subscription is through the Google Play Store.  You do this by going into the Cadpage Settings and pressing
Payment Status > Purchase through Android Market.
Purchases made this way will update your payment status almost immediately.

You can log into to wallet.google.com and see if they list a reason why things aren't working, like an expired credit card.

We also take PayPal & snail mail payments.   Details on how to do that can be found at http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support/paypal-payments

Basically, you can make a check or money order payable to Cadpage and mail it to

Cadpage
35136 Kings Valley Hwy
Philomath, OR 97370

If you do this, please include your Cadpage User email address (usually a gmail account) so I can make sure you get credit for it.

If you need a 30-day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
HTDRIABA or htdriaba.  It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks for your support,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

******************************************************************

Try logging in to wallet.google.com and see if there is something that needs to be set up there.  If you don't have a wallet account, you may need to set one up.  If you have a wallet account set up with credit card or payment info, go back to your phone and open the Market app.  Then press
menu > accounts
And make sure the account listed is the one you set up in wallet.google.com

Hopefully that will let you make Play Store purchases.  If it doesn't let us know and we will try to work something else out.

If you need a 30-day extension, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
 WPDQGPDA or wpdqgpda.  It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ____.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Thanks for your support,
-Ken

******************************************************************

If you can't map calls, Cadpage isn't really working and you shouldn't  have to pay for it.

So we need to fix things.  I can give you a 30-day extension to give us time to work on it.  To get this, open the Cadpage settings and press Payment Status, then press the "I have an authorization code" button, and enter an authorization code of
 WPDQGPDA or wpdqgpda.   It is a time-sensitive code and will expire by midnight on ___.  Once you use it, it will be good for about 30 days.

Next, you need to send me the information on the calls that are not mapping.  You do this by long pressing the call and selecting Report Problem from the menu list.  That generates an email to us with lots of cool technical information needed to figure out what is wrong.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, go into Settings and press the Email the Developer settings as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message.  Which will hopefully be enough to help me figure out what is wrong.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************

No problem. I have added your name and current User email address to a backup authorization server.

******************************************************************

This problem has been fixed in the beta release that you can install from  http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/

Sorry for the inconvenience,

******************************************************************

This should be fixed in the current Cadpage release, which is available from Google Play Store.

Have a nice day,

******************************************************************

The number/address reported as sending your dispatch alerts has changed.
 I will update the default filter to include that in the next Cadpage
release.  For now you can just override it.

Go into Location Settings and check the box labeled "Override Location
Filter".  Then set the "From: (filter)" setting to
12101

Good luck,

******************************************************************
** Why do people have to pay for this
******************************************************************

You are going to have to install the regular Cadpage app first.  The free/no-support version doesn't have any of the support options you are going to need.

If you install the regular version of Cadpage, you have a 30 day evaluation period that you can use to work out whatever is going wrong.  If you're lucky, and it doesn't require any code changes, you can go back to using the free version when that 30 days is up.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************

For the long story, see http://www.cadpage.org/financial-support.

Short answer,there are, and will always be, ways to run Cadpage without paying anything.

And, Cadpage is licensed under the GPL, which makes if free software in the "free speech" rather than "free beer" sense.  It allows anyone to copy the Cadpage source code and use it as the basis for their own product.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Locations
******************************************************************

You are still using the General location setting.  The general location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.  To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a location setting that will know more about your specific message format and can get a lot more information from it.

******************************************************************************

That's about as good as we can get with a generic location.  The generic parser has to process CAD pages of any format, and can only do this by making some very basic assumptions.  Assumptions that will frequently be wrong for specific locations.   You will get much better results by requesting a new location coded for your specific dispatch text format.

******************************************************************************

This isn't the text format we are expecting for <<LOCATION>>.  This happens all of the time and usually means you are dispatched from a different 911 center than we wrote this location for.  It just means we have to write a new location for you.

******************************************************************************

This isn't one of the many text formats we are expecting for Suffolk County.  Apparently dispatch changed the way page are sent and  we need to write a new parser for you.

******************************************************************************
Details on setting up a new location
******************************************************************************
Cadpage works by processing the dispatch alerts your department arranges to have sent to your phone.  The problem is that there is no standard alert page format.  We have to write a separate alert message parser for each dispatch center.  And we can only do that if someone sends us some examples of what their alerts look like.

The first step is to make sure that you are already getting text alerts when your department is dispatched to a call.  If you are not getting these already, you need to talk to someone in your department about having them sent to your phone.

We like to have at least 5 sample text messages before we try writing a new location parser, but can go with less if we have to.  We need to know what area they are for, possibly which dispatch center they come from.  And what email address/phone number is used to send them.

All of this needs to be emailed to our main support address: support@cadpage.org.  If the messages are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and paste them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list.  If you just forward text messages, please add a separate message telling us who you are and what sender address/phone number was used to send the alerts.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support.   And then you can use the long press > Report Problem method to send us new sample alerts.

Good Luck and Thanks for your interest,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

*****************************************************************

OK, <<<>>> will be supported in the next release, probably next Sunday  If you want it earlier than that this should be in beta release at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage tomorrow morning.

You are entitled to a free one year subscription for helping us set up a new location.  You just have to ask for it, preferably by using the Cadpage "Email the Developer" feature, so we know which account name has to be added to the subscription list.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************

We are about ready to roll out an improved parser for you.  There are some mapping problems with some calls. Google could not locate any of the following.

If these address really exist, you can report them to Google as a mapping problem.  Find the correct location in maps.google.com, then click the Report a Problem link in the bottom right hand corner.  I pick Road/Street > Other road/street/path problem, then type in the search string and tell them that that search did not find this location.

If there is something we can change do a better job of finding the correct location, please let us know.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** DISPATCH FMT CHANGE?
******************************************************************

Hi folks,

We have gotten a report that the <<<<>>>> dispatch text pages are no longer working with Cadpage.  I need to know if they are still working for you.  If they are, I will need to retain the current functionality when I rewrite the text parser.  If not, can you report any examples of what your text pages look like now.  Just long  press all of the calls and select Report Problem to generate an email to us with information about the call.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

*****************************************************************
** General problems
******************************************************************

When a call comes in as an SMS text page, and Cadpage doesn't do anything to it, it automatically appears in the messaging inbox.  So if you don't want non-CAD pages to be handled as general alerts, we just don't do anything.

Direct paging is different.  If Cadpage doesn't handle them, they just disappear.  Since this seemed like an undesirable outcome, Cadpage always handles a direct page message.  If it isn't a real CAD page it will be treated as  a general alert, regardless of the process General Alert setting.   However, many people are, like yourself, unhappy with this state of affairs.  But we aren't sure what to do about it.

CodeMessaging is going to try to give users more options about whether non-page calls are sent to you or not.  But this really doesn't solve the problem, does it.

It would be easy enough to have Cadpage honor the process general alert setting for direct pages.  But as I explained, they will not show in you message inbox if we do this, they will completely disappear.  Is this what you would prefer?

In theory, I could turn the request into something that looks like an SMS text message and pass it to the messaging app.  This is a lot harder job that reading SMS messages.  To create them I have to get a lot of things  right.  But it probably could be done, and probably is the best solution to this particular problem.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** text page information is truncated
******************************************************************

Not much we can do about that.  All network carriers have limits how long an SMS text message can be.  If dispatch tries to send you something longer than that, it gets truncated.  There are things the message sending service can do to get around that.  But nothing we can do on the receiving end.

The only thing you can do is switch to a different message sending service.  Two in particular, CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com, can send pages through the the data networks, bypassing SMS text message limits altogether.

Good luck

* Reports of general direct paging deliver failures
******************************************************************

That has been in infrequent but persistent problem with direct page ever since we implemented it.  I keep adding new workarounds to avoid the issue.  While none of them can be considered a real fix, they appear to have reduced the problem substantially.

One new development is that I now have a Google engineer who wants to help troubleshoot the problem.  What he needs is a hard example of a page that was picked up by Active911 but never received, or received after a long delay, by your device.  If have an incident where that  happens, look up the alert ID in the Active911 web page for your department and use the Email the Developer setting in Cadpage to send it to us.

My various workarounds have reduced the problem incidence rate to such an extent that I have having a hard time getting a user to report an actual delivery failure.

Thanks a bunch,
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* Cadpage is not registered with Active911
* Registration ID is not null
* Swift shows correct page type and registration ID
******************************************************************

Very occasionally, people are having trouble registering with
Active911.  There are a couple things you can try, usually something works.


*** For Android versions >= 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings
Scroll down to the Account settings and select Google
Verify that the Google Play account is syncing properly (ie.. that the last sync date/time is fairly recent)

*** For Android versions < 4.0
Go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings > Accounts & Sync > Google > Sync
and see if everything synchronizes.

Go into Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > I have an authorization code
and enter a code of "zapit".

Restart the device and try again.

This takes care of 95% of the reported problems.  If it does not there
are some odder tricks that are occasionally required.

Power down your device, remove the SD card, then power it up and
register Cadpage with Active911.  I have no idea why this would make any
difference, but it got one user up and running.

Take care,
-Ken

***************************************************************************
* Active911 user not receiving pages
* Cadpage shows it is registered with Active911
* Swift shows correct page type and registration ID
******************************************************************

Everything looks like it is set up properly.  And your department is getting Active911 pages.

First, you can go into Cadpage settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging
We do not know why, but doing this usually fixes this kind of problem.

Then get whoever sets up your device with Active911 to use the Active911 web page to send a test message to your phone.

If you do get the test page, but still do not receive real dispatch alerts, then something about your Active911 settings, probably the duty status, is preventing them from sending dispatch pages to you.  If your department Active911 administrator cannot figure out what that is, try contacting Active911 support for help.

If the test message does not arrive in a timely manner, there is some kind of problem with the underlying Google message push protocol.  Try  turning off your phone WiFi and see if alerts can be delivered while you are connected to the mobile carrier data network.  If this works, there is probably a firewall on your WiFi access point that is blocking outgoing connections to ports 5228-5230.  If you cannot do anything to fix that, you may have to disable access to that access point.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
* Text paging delays
******************************************************************

You are getting text pages, and the only reason Cadpage alerting will be delayed for text pages is because the messages are just not arriving at your device in a timely fashion.  If you want to prove this, go into Cadpage Additional Settings and check the box labeled "Pass Calls through to SMS Client".  With that set, all calls will be passed to your message inbox in addition to alerting Cadpage and you can confirm the extent to which the messages are delayed.

According to the message timestamps, it took only <*> seconds for the carrier to deliver this call to you, which would imply that the delay was introduced by the dispatch messaging service.  But this should not be considered hard proof, I have some suspicions that carriers are holding messages in a system queue for some reason and that the total delay is not represented by this number.

You can also try sending yourself text messages when these delays are observed to see if those messages are also being delayed.  But when it comes down to it, about the only thing you can really do is complain to the carrier and/or dispatch service about the delays.

It might be worth considering switching to another messaging service.  CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com are reasonably priced and can push pages to your device without relying on text messaging and will probably fix your delay problem.  Unless the dispatch center is slow getting the pages out, in which case they have logs to prove that and some clout to take the issue up with dispatch IT people.  And Cadpage doesn't bug you about paying for a subscription when you are getting direct pages from them.

** Active911 registration issues

It looks like you have run into a new Google registration problem.  We are still trying to get a handle on how to deal with it.  Lacking any other great ideas at this point, can you try uninstalling and re-installing Cadpage.  That seems to have worked for at least one other user.

** Recent PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR
** Null RegistrationID
** Cadpage version < 1.6.29
******************************************************************

Something has been going haywire with the Google infrastructure supporting direct paging some time ago.  It only impacts a small percentage of direct paging users, but that is small comfort to those who are impacted.  We have been complaining to Google but so far have not gotten any response.

The latest version of Cadpage has some new logic to help alleviate, but not completely eliminate, the problem.  Try installing that and see if that gets things working.

If it does not, use the Email the Developer feature to report the situation and we will see what we can do from there.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Recent PHONE_REGISTRATION_ERROR
** Null RegistrationID
** Cadpage version >= 1.6.29
******************************************************************

It looks like you are one of the users who cannot get the Google registration you need to implement direct paging.  Usually just retrying it a few times is enough to get things working.  But sometimes more serious measures are called for.

If you have not tried it yet, try uninstalling and re-installing Cadpage.  You will have to register your device with CodeMessaging or Active911 again, hoping it succeeds this time.

If that doesn't work, leave it and come back and try again in a couple hours.  It may just take some time to get Google's servers to respond to us.

If that does not work, we are starting to get desperate.  But first, double check that the account associated with Google Play Store is valid.  To do that, open the Play Store App and select
Menu > Accounts
and verify that the selected account is the one you expect.

*** For Android versions >= 4.0
Then go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings
Scroll down to the Account settings and select Google
Verify that the Google Play account is syncing properly (ie.. that the last sync date/time is fairly recent)

*** For Android versions < 4.0
Then go back to the Android home screen and select
Menu > Settings > Accounts & Sync > Google > Sync
and see if everything synchronizes.

Next, go back to Cadpage Settings and try to register with Active911/Code Messaging again.

If that does not work, we are down to recommending a factory reset.  This a rather drastic solution, but it has, thus far, always resolved this particular problem.

******************************************************************
* Duplicate pages with Active911
******************************************************************

Duplicate messages are fairly common for new Active911 users.   Some time back, you arranged to have text pages sent to your phone.  Those pages don't stop coming when you register with Active911.  As a result you always get two pages for each incident.

You have to talk to someone in your department about stopping the original text pages.  Probably the same person who got them sent to your phone in the first place.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************

Your phone is running Android 2.1.  Direct Paging relies on a Google messaging service that is only supported for 2.2 and up.

Your options are limited.  First check to see if your vendor has any system upgrades available
main > Menu > Settings > Software Update > Check New
and try installing them.

If there are no updates available, your only option is to get a new phone, or root the existing phone and install your own OS.  Directions for rooting most phones can be found on the Internet.  The process isn't nearly as dangerous as it sounds.  The important thing to make an NAND backup as soon as you have the recovery partition installed.  You can use that to restore the phone to pristine unrooted status if that becomes necessary.

******************************************************************
LATE PAGES:

If you can long press one of the calls you get and select Report Problem to send them to us, I could give you a better idea what is happening.  I need to see all of the alerts that are associated with one of your calls.

******************************************************************
** Cadpage is not working
******************************************************************

That may mean something has changed about your dispatch alerts and Cadpage is no longer recognizing them.  I need to see what your dispatch alerts look like now before I can fix anything.

Are dispatch alerts showing up in your message inbox?  If not, you have to talk to someone in your department about getting them sent to your phone.

If they are showing up in your message inbox, but Cadpage is not picking them up, use the "Email the Developer" setting to send us a new support email right after Cadpage fails to pick up an alert. The email should include details about the last text message so I can figure out what needs to be done.

If Cadpage is picking up the alerts, but they are not mapping correctly, long press them and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************
** Cadapge quit working - still getting text alerts
******************************************************************

That usually means that something has changed about your dispatch alerts and Cadpage is no longer recognizing them.  We need to see what your alerts look like now before we can fix anything.

The best way to get them to us is to use the "Email the Developer" setting to send us a new support email right after Cadpage fails to pick up an alert.   If you still have the dispatch alerts in your message inbox, you can also forward them to support@cadpage.org.  If you do that, please include a separate message telling us who you are and what number/email address is used to send the alerts.

Good luck,
-Ken

******************************************************************

We need more information about your calls to figure out what is going wrong.

If you have calls that are not mapping, long press the call and select "Report Problem" from the option menu.  That generates an email to us with the info about the call.

If Cadpage is missing calls entirely, go into settings and press the Email the Developer setting as soon as possible.  The email that generates includes information about the most recently received text message..

******************************************************************

This call parsed fine (with the fixed logic) but it isn't mapping.  Google can't find an address for
<<< LOCATION >>>

Does this address really exist? If it does, you short report this to Google as a search problem.  Just locate the correct location with a web browser using maps.google.com, click the Report a Problem link at the bottom right corner of the screen.  I click other for a type and tell them that the above search string did not find this address.

If Dispatch has the address wrong, or if there is something we can do to come up with a search string that will locate the correct address.  Let us know what it is and we will try to make that adjustment in Cadpage.

*** Scanner setup

You have to set up some things before the Start Radio button will work

1) You have to install the Scanner Radio or Scanner Radio Pro app.

2) Open the Scanner Radio app and select one or more favorite channels that you want to listen to.

3) Then, open Cadpage Location Settings, scroll down to the bottom and use the Scanner Channel setting to select one of the Scanner Radio favorite channels.

4) If you want the channel to open automatically when a new call is received, check the box labeled "Auto Open Scanner Channel".

The Start Radio button should now launch the Scanner Radio app listening to the selected channel.

This doesn't magically turn your Android device into a shortwave radio receiver.  Scanner Radio works by relaying Internet feeds from volunteers across the country who have set up audio feeds from real hardware scanners.  If no one has set this up in your area your are out of luck.

Take care,
-Ken

******************************************************************
*** Scanner problems

Everything looks like it is set up correctly. Check to make sure that the scanner channel you are trying to activate is still online.  If it is not, Scanner cannot play it.

If that isn't it, I need to see a copy of the system log recording one of these launch failures.  You can install any number of log viewing apps, I use Logcat myself, and use it to email a copy of the log to support@cadpage.org.  This needs to be done right after you get a call that fails to launch scanner radio.

*** For NEW messages:

Cadpage will not do anything with your current settings.

The intended purpose of Cadpage is to support emergency responders who get text pages from a central dispatch center when they are asked to respond to an emergency.  Cadpage takes those pages, displays the information from them, and gives the user the option to bring up a Google map showing the location of the incident.Then they can ask for directions to that location.

First, make sure you are getting text pages sent to your phone when a call is toned out.  If you are not, talk to someone in your department about getting that set up.

Next, go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or work.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting.  Set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support.

Please contact us again if you still have difficulties with Cadpage.

There are only two reasons why the Direct Paging Vendor menu will be grayed out.

The most likely, and most difficult to fix, is that direct paging is only supported in Android 2.2 and up.  If you phone is still running Andoroid 2.1, you need to either upgrade your phone system, or purchase a new phone.  Carriers are notoriously slow about providing upgrades for the phones they sell you.  If you can't get one through the normal channels, you may have to look into rooting the phone and installing your own Android system.

The second possible reason is that you installed and are running the free/no-support variant of Cadpage.  Direct paging is not supported by that variant.  If you are using it you will need to install the regular version of Cadpage.  You will not be expected to pay anything for it, Cadpage is free for user registered with Active911.

******************************************************************

You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are displayed as yellow text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a (Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

Occasionally users end up with call history filled with unopened calls.  At which point Cadpage starts deleting calls as soon as you open them.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,

iphone options; also ipad?
******************************************************************

There are two Cadpage-like solutions for iPhone, but both require that
you get your pages through either CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com.
The reason for this is the IOS environment does not allow normal apps to
intercept text messages like we do on Android phones, so we have to use
a messaging service that has some other way to push pages to the phone app.

**********************************************************************

We deal with Cadpage, an exclusively Android app.

There are 2 main options for iPhone Users:

1.  Cadpage For IOS is on the market.  You can contact Jesse at support@apprhythmia.com
However, you will still need a messaging service like Active911 or CodeMessaging for his app to work.

2.  If you sign up with Active911.com as your paging service, they have their own IPhone app that pretty much does what Cadpage does on Android phones.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

Need to contact iphone app service

We deal with Cadpage, an exclusively Android app.

You are likely using at least one of the 2 main options for iPhone Users:

1.  For Cadpage For IOS, you can contact Jesse at support@apprhythmia.com

2.  For Active911, you can contact their support at Active911.com.

We apologize for any confusion concerning these apps.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

***********************************************************************

There really isn't any reason to purchase the Cadpage/IOS app.  There is
a free Cadpage for CodeMessaging app that works with CodeMessaging, and
Active911 has their own IOS app.  Either will provide more or less
equivalent functionality with Cadpage/Android.

We do not distribute the Cadpage/IOS app, you will have to contact Jesse
at support@apprhythmia.com if you want a refund on your purchase.

*****************************************************************
Cadpage is exclusively for Android devices.  But we partner with Active911 and CodeMessaging, which are both messaging services and can handle iphones and ipads.  There is also a new company on the block, Cadpage For IOS,which delivers Cadpage-like services to iphones, and maybe to ipads. However, with Cadpage For IOS, you would still need a messaging service like Active911 or CodeMessaging. We are 4 separate companies.

Are you still with me?

If you pay for a subscription with Active911 (for individuals or departments) or CodeMessaging (only departments), then Cadpage is free if you use direct paging.  Many departments are following this trend.  We at Cadpage help with writing parsers, so we get some payment from both services.  If your subscription is less than 6 months old, we would be happy to reimburse you.

Here are some contact email addresses for your further exploration:
Active911.com
CodeMessaging.net
Jesse at  support@apprhythmia.com is the developer of Cadpage For IOS

I hope that helps!

Mapping from wrong system
******************************************************************

You have to uninstall (or just clear the defaults) for the mapping program that has been set as the default mapping app.

How you do this depends on the version of Android you have.  For ICS and above use
Main > Menu > Application Manager > (Wrong mapping app) > Clear Defaults

For Gingerbread and below it is
Main > Menu > Settings > Applications > Manage Applications > (Wrong mapping app) > Clear Defaults

Cadpage is an Android app that generally will not run on a PC system.  We do have some clever users that have gotten it running using the BlueStacks Android emulator.  Obviously the Windows hardware will receive text messages, so the pages have to be delivered through one of the two message services (CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com) that can push pages to Cadpage without using text messaging.

We don't officially support this, and it is a lot of work to set up.  But it can and has been done.

The old RingtonePickerActivity crash.  We see this every now and then.  Only with your specific model of phone and only with that particular version of the Android operating system.  A problem report has been opened for this
http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=15472
But nothing seems to be happening with it, unsurprising as developers aren't all that interested in things that only happen to a vendor specific and probably customized version of Android.

If you can get a Android upgrade from your vender, most people are on 2.2 by now, I would install that.  Otherwise you might want to consider rooting your phone and installing your own Android system.  Failing that, you will probably just have to live with this.

Basically, they have to find a way to send SMS text messages to individual mobile phones.  I've never been involved in that process.  It sounds like this may involve two or more parties with dispatch sending an email to one specific email address where some other agency takes charge to pushing it out to the mobile phones.

As for how the text message is formatted, we can work with just about anything, but we really like obvious delimiters between fields and consistent field usage.  Presumably they are using some kind of CAD software, and that will probably limit there message formatting options.

If they are entering free form text, I would recommend something like

call description; address; @place name; #apt; city; cross st 1; cross st 2; general info

Place name and apt are optional, you can skip them if they aren't needed.  We can tell if they are present or not by checking for a leading @ or #
Samples

STRUCTURE FILE; 322 N PINE ST; @MOTEL 6; #7; PORTLAND; 1ST AVE; 2ND AVE; SINGLE APT FIRE
GRASS FILE;124 E 16TH ST; CHICAGO; BROWN AVE;; ABOUT 50 FT DIAMETER

note that double semicolons are used to leave an empty field where there are less that two cross streets

Hope that helps,

******************************************************************

Unfortunately, this problem originates deep in the Android operating system.  Something that we, as application developers, cannot address directly.  All we can do is collect as much information as we can and report it as a problem on the Android forums and hope someone gets around to fixing it someday.  If we are real lucky, this experimenting might identify some configuration settings that triggers the crash, and that you can avoid by changing that setting.

Does it happen every time you get a CAD page, or only this particular message?  Does it happen when you get non-CAD pages?  How about when Cadpage notifications are disabled?  Or when SMS pass through to Messaging app is enabled?  How about when you use the test last message option in the location settings?

Something that would really help is to install an application viewer (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after a crash.

It is possible to past text from the search history into an email, it just isn't obvious.

1) Bring up the message display and map it.
2) Press the Map app search box or search button.  This brings up a list of past map search strings.  The one we want is at the top  of the screen.
3) Use the Trackball/optical mouse to select the top entry, which moves it into the search box.
4) Long press the search box.  When you get the long press menu select copy.
5) Next return to the Cadpage display dialog
6) Select menu then report problem
7) Leave both checkboxes checked and press Send
8) This puts you into the mail app with a prefilled message.  Long press the top of the message and select paste from the long press menu
9) Hopefully you just inserted the Map search string into the message.  Send the message.

* Emai support request
***************************************************************************

Not directly, for a variety of complicated technical reasons, Cadpage support for emailed alerts is just not going to happen.

There are indirect ways to make this happen.  The best is to sign up with the Active911.com messaging service.  They can take your email alerts and push them to Cadpage without relying on text messages, which avoids a lot of problems.

Alternatively, all cell network vendors maintain email address that will turn email into SMS or MMS text messages.  You can either forward or direct your email alerts to these addresses.

For Verizon, the email address are
NNNNNNNNNN@vtext.com for text messages and
NNNNNNNNNN@vzwpix.com for MMS messages

Other vendors have different gateway addresses.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

Google navigation responds to navigate requests, which are different that map requests.  We could provide an option to have Cadpage send a navigate request instead of the map request, but have chosen not to for a couple reasons.

First it isn't necessary.  I takes you two taps to get from Google maps to Google navigation.  Tap the address bubble that displays on the map screen, then the directions button.  If you go into the Map app settings and select Labs, and then enable the Bubble Buttons feature, it will put a navigation button in the address bubble, saving you a keypress.

Second, Cadpage/Google Maps are good, but they are not perfect.  Occasionally Google Maps will find a completely totally wrong location, sometimes in the next state or county.  Having to go through the map app to get navigation directions gives the user a chance to eyeball the general location and observe that the mapped location is totally bogus.   If we let users jump directly into navigation, they might not figure out that the mapped location was wrong until they were halfway to the next county.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

The bad news is that Cadpage isn't going to work in your district.

Cadpage expects a text message from dispatch that contains all of the address and call information it needs to generate a map location.  Unfortunately, your dispatch center sounds like one of the old ones that can not or will not generate text messages when a call is dispatched.

The text messages you are getting are not coming from Dispatch.  They are coming from a messaging service agency which has found a clever way to work around the dispatch center's failings.  They have some radio equipment in your area that listens for dispatch tones on the dispatch frequency, and saves the voice communication the immediately follows it.  This is uploaded to their server, which then generates the text  messages to everyone on the distribution list.  The text message gives users a link that user can click on which downloads the original voice message from the agency server and plays it.

It is a clever solution, but unfortunately not one that Cadpage can take advantage of.  To retrieve the call information, we would have to open the audio file ourselves and run it through a speech to text converter, then parse the result.  It would be an enormous amount of work for what, we hope, will be  very small number of users.

The only real solution is to convince your dispatch center to upgrade their equipment

Sorry for the bad news,

You don't have to go back to text messages. All you have to do is stop installing new Cadpage releases.  You can run the current version of Cadpage forever, all it will do is display a modest red demo expired notice when time runs out.

And if you ever need something fixed sometime in the future, you can always pay something for it then.

Have a nice day,

******************************************************************

As best we can tell, Oneida county sends dispatch alerts with line breaks between fields.  But at least one of the forwarding services they are using to convert those alerts into SMS text pages is stripping out the line breaks and leaving nothing to separate the data fields.  As a result, they all run together, and there is no way for use to accurately split them out again.

Some users, at some times, have gotten text messages with the line breaks intact.  Other users have gotten text messages with the line breaks have been replaced with '>' symbols.  Both of these can be handled.  But users who get text messages where the line breaks have been removed are SOL.

Someone needs to track down how these dispatch alerts get generated and talk someone into changing things.  If the unidentified forwarding service will either leave the line breaks in place, or replace them with something else, all will be well. If Dispatch can use some other character to separate data fields in the dispatch alerts, it won't matter what the forwarding service does with them.

Take care,

I'm trying to make enough from Cadpage users to keep making this my full time occupation.  I think this is in the users interest, if I can't do this and have to get a real paying job, Cadpage maintenance will decline dramatically.  And the way text formats change all over the time, that would make it unusable for large numbers of people.

I'm asking for $9.99/year, which isn't very much in terms of how much people usually pay just to have an Android phone.  But I'm also committed to making sure people who can not, or just will not, pay anything can continue to use it.

1) You can roll back to the v1.4.32 version has no real enforcement logic.  If the demo runs out it will just display a demo expired notice and go happily on its way.
2) If you run through the payment status menu, there is a "I can't afford $9.99" that gives you a chance to send us an email explaining why you can't pay that.  I'm pretty easy with these, as long as you don't insult me I'll probably give you a free 1 year subscription.
3) You can uninstall and reinstall Cadpage, which resets the 30 day demo clock.  You can do this as often as you want. Cadpage tries to make this easier by giving you a Reinstall Cadpage button when the demo expires.

It is also worth mentioning that Cadpage is distributed under an open source license.  Which makes it free software in the "Free Speech", rather than the "Free Beer" sense.  Anyone who doesn't like the way I am running things is free to take the source code and use it to create their own product.

Hope that makes sense.  If you have any better ideas on how we can keep Cadpage running, I would be happy to hear them.

***************************************************************************

OK, this is going to get a bit complicated.

You must be using the general location.  Current versions of Cadpage suspend the evaluation period while you are using the generic location, largely because performance and reliability are so poor and you aren't getting the full benefit of the Cadpage product.  That's what gives you the sponsored by Cadpage message.  If you had a recognized paid subscription along with the General location, it would have reported that.  But when you switched phones and lost the paid subscriber status, it started report the sponsored status rather start report you as having a limited time evaluation demo.

If you were using a supported location before the phone switch, just go into Location settings and select that location.  Then reload the payment status and all should be as it was.

If you were using the general location before the phone switch, there is no real problem, you can run Cadpage like this forever without it bugging you for more money.

Or you can go into Location settings and temporarily select a real location specific location.  That will put you back in demo mode, which will let you reload the payment status which should fix everything.  After which you can switch back to the general location.

But what we really want you to do is request a new location for your area.  That will probably be ready for the next release, and after you switch to that one location you can reload the payment status.

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2 calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would help a lot.

All of this needs to be emailed to are main support address support@cadpage.org.  If they are already in Cadpage call history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or copy and past them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information we can add the location to the list.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the from: filter to whoever appears in the from: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

***************************************************************************

I do have concerns about using Cadpage as your primary navigation tool.  It is pretty good, but it is only as reliable as Google maps, and Google maps has some weaknesses.
1) It's ability to accurately find an address accurately goes down substantially in areas where it doesn't have access to property rolls.  Which appears to be the case for your area.
2) It can't find interchanges, overpasses, and mile markers.  This is principally a problem with limited access highways, which are, again, common in your district.
3) It won't tell you about special conditions, like bridge weight limits, that might be in your department map books.  You can remedy this one by setting up custom map layers.

I've been impressed with how well it works, and would actually consider using it as a primary navigation tool in districts like ours, where Google does have access to online property rolls and we have no limited access highways.  But unfortunately your district appears to lack those two conditions.

Still, Cadpage official policy disclaimer reads....

This application should NOT be used as a primary dispatch method. Neither the developers or Google will be responsible for sending you to the wrong address or mapping errors. It is your responsibility to determine if the address looks to be correct and to have an alternate means of verification. This is a supplemental aid only and can be wrong, fail to operate correctly, crash, or in some other way not work as intended which usually happens at the worst time possible. We try to make the app work in the best manner possible and to not crash and in general it should not attract hungry brown bears to your location. However there are no guarantees made.

Have a nice day,

***************************************************************************

I'm getting several complaints that notification sound doesn't work (unless the Notification Override is on)  Whis is very puzzling because I haven't changed anything about the notification logic for probably more than a year.

Of course, my sound plays with no problems whatsoever, which makes it hard to tell what is going wrong.

In the grasping at straws category, try cycling power on the device.  It's worked before for odd sound problems.

If that doesn't work, we're going to have to look at your system log.  Try installing a log view (I use LogcatVW), and use that to capture and report the contents of your system log just after you get a Cadpage alert.

Blackberry Users

Cadpage was developed as an Android app.  An IPhone version has recently been released, but that only happened because an IOS developer wanted to do it.

****************************************************************************

Sponsored Locations

An emergency dispatch center or a collection of departments served by that center can choose to sponsor the Cadpage location that services that center.  End users using only sponsored locations will not be expected to make any further financial contributions.

Department Sponsorship

This is more suited for single departments.  Each department is responsible for maintaining a list of the members they are sponsoring.  When the list changes, the entire list should be forwarded to the Cadpage support address and we will incorporate it into the next release.  Users on the sponsored list are considered to have a paid subscription for the year.  See Department Member List Format for the required list format.

Pricing

We expect payment of something like $5 / user for sponsored locations and $7/user for department sponsors.  But we aren't keeping track and will accept pretty much anything you decide to give us.  Prices may jump in future depending on events beyond our control, see Pricing Disclaimer.  Checks can be mailed to

******************************************************************************
** MMS throws security exception
******************************************************************************

This has been a continuing mystery.  The code Cadpage uses to handle MMS messages relies on some undocumented back door interfaces to the messaging system.  As of Jellybean (Android 4.1) we started seeing this throw a security exception.  Which was unfortunate, but not completely surprising.  Of late, the situation has gotten more complicated.   Several users on JellyBean and higher versions of Android are running this with no problem.  And one user ran into this on Gingerbread (2.3) Android.

I am thinking it may have something to do with how security options are set, or which messaging app is handling the MMS messages.  If you can figure out what makes this stop and start happening we would be very very grateful.

The latest versions of Cadpage trap the abort.  So it does not crash on you.  But it probably won't work either.  If you are really are getting dispatch alerts as MMS messages, there are not many options.  Playing with the message app MMS options so that it automatically downloads all message content might fix things.  But we really just do not know.

We do have our own internal paging service now which gives you another way to workaround this issue.  Since you are a paid subscriber, you can register with that paging service and it will create a personal dispatch email address for you.  If you have your dispatch alerts sent to that email address, they will be forwarded to Cadpage through the mobile data network.  Since no text or MMS messaging is involved, any problems with processing MMS messages are sidestepped.

Take care,
-Ken

Dear ____ Department --

I have been doing some internal auditing of our Cadpage app and found that there is no record of your payment.

I have the following members registered as Cadpage Users as of __________:

________
________

A Cadpage subscription is $9.99 per year, but department sponsorships are given a 30% discount.  Therefore this account would only amount to $21. I can prepare a more formal invoice at your request.  The subscription will expire on ______.

Please let me know if this is in error, or if you are having any problems with Cadpage.

Thank you for your support and understanding.

*************************************************************************

Does Cadpage require an active data connection?

Yes it does.  It needs either Internet connectivity or an active phone
connection to receive the dispatch pages in the first place.  And it
needs Internet connectivity to map the call locations.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

*************************************************************************

This used to be a common problem, one that we have never really gotten a good handle on.  But I haven't heard it reported for a good while, which makes me suspect (hope) that is limited to pre-ICS versions of Android.  If there is an Android system update available for your device, installing it may make this problem go away.

When you have the Override Notification setting checked, Cadpage skips the usual notification procedure and instead uses the Media Player to play are specific alert tone at full volume.  One some devices, the Media Player apparently cannot play our alert ringtone and Cadpage crashes.  Exactly why only those few devices are impacted remains a mystery.  The simple workaround is to turn off the Override Notification setting in Notification Settings.

Take care,
-Ken

*************************************************************************
run Cadpage on cell and tablet?

You do not need an authorization code to run Cadpage anywhere.  If you
have a paid subscription for your cell phone, it will automatically carry
over to the tablet, or any other phone you have, as long as both devices
have configured Google Play Store to use the same email account.

If you are still having trouble, use the Email the Developer feature to
send us an email from both the phone and tablet.

Please note, while there is no problem at all running Cadpage on Android
tablets, you may have trouble getting pages to the tablet.  Most
Android tablets cannot receive SMS or MMS messages.  If you have one of
the lucky ones that do, life is good.  If not, the only way you can get
pages to the tablet is if you use CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as
your message service.

*******************************************************************
explanation of DEMO status vs PAID for length of time left

All is working as it should.  You have a paid subscription that will expire on 3/15/13.  But you reinstalled Cadpage on 1/27/13, and since then you have used only 5 days of the allotted 30 day evaluation period.  Cadpage does the math and figures your new evaluation period expires somewhere around 3/29/13.   Since you get more time as an evaluation demo that you do under the paid subscription, it reports the evaluation demo status.

The process isn't perfect, since you don't see the paid subscription expiration warning, you don't get informed that you can continue to run Cadpage beyond that date as long as you do not install a released published after that date.  But that still is an option.

Hope that all made sense,
Ken

Sound problems == > Why is my alert sound only a couple seconds?

First, try restarting your phone.  That seems to fix most unexplained
sound problems.

If that does not fix things, try changing to a different notification
sound?  Possibly the one you have selected is only a few seconds long.

Does the vibrate option work as expected?

You can test the notification alert by going into Notification settings
and pressing the Test Notification button.  Easier than waiting for a
new call to come in.

> when are you going to get hydrant locations for Android?


Not anytime soon I fear.  There are some extremely difficult technical
issues that would need to be resolved.  And Cadpage probably isn't the
right place to implement such a thing.  You really want hydrant
information saved and maintained on some kind of central server where it
could be accessed by everyone in your department.  Keeping individual
phones updated with current data creates it's own set of problems.

I can think of two ways to get hydrant information into the map
displays.  The first would be to write your own Google custom map layer
and make it public.  The map layer could be automatically displayed when
Cadpage displays a map of your area.  The drawing tools supported by
Google are really crude.  You can't draw simple points for example.  I
did some experimenting and found that you can make a good approximation
of hydrant locations by drawing very small thick lines.

The second would be to switch to Active911.com for your message
servicing.  They do support custom map displays with hydrant locations.
 Unfortunately these would not show up in the Cadpage or Google map
displays.  You would have to use their IPhone or Android app, or display their
incident web page to see them.

Take care,
-Ken

Explanation of Cadpage For IOS, Active911 and CodeMessaging

Caution!  An "earful" of information is about to be revealed!

Well, Cadpage For IOS is a different company run by a fellow named Jesse.  His contact email address is (support@apprhythmia.com).  It is an app for iphones, but to use it, you would need a messaging service like Active911 (Active911.com) or CodeMessaging (CodeMessaging.net).   These services push pages from dispatch to cell phones.  If you use a plain cell phone, they use text messaging.  If you use Cadpage or an iphone, they can push pages without using text messages.

We are Cadpage for Android phones, and have a deal with Active911 and CodeMessaging.  If you pay for one of those services, and use direct paging, then Cadpage is free.  Not so with Cadpage For IOS.  Jesse runs that separately.

Active911 is generally $12 per year, and deals with individuals as well as departments.  CodeMessaging is paid by departments, and starts at $29.99 per month.  Active911 also has an app for IOS devices to use in conjuction with the messaging service.

In summary, your iphone User is on his own, unless your department switches to a messaging service as I have mentioned above.

I hope this helps.  It has been an interesting time in this business!  We would be glad to help you if you decide to transition to Active911 or CodeMessaging, as we do get paid through them as well.

Thanks for your support and your inquiry.
Jean

In your second phone, go to Android settings --- Accounts -- Add new account --- select Google --- existing --- email.

fix this up?:

You might look into the FirefighterLog app.  It is published by somebody
else, but it will pick up the page information displayed by Cadpage and
will save it in a real database for long term retrieval and reporting
purposes.

Once you trial period expires, Cadpage will quit displaying call
details, which makes it more or less useless.  You are given options to
ask for another free day, I think you can do that 8 times.  Or to
reinstall Cadpage which will reset your demo period but loose all
Cadpage settings and history.

If you want to report your responding status to IamResponding, you can
configure Cadpage to call the phone number that IamResponding give you.
 To do that, go into Cadpage settings and select
Additional Settings > Button Configuration > Response Button Menu
and set the Button 2 Phone/Code setting to the number you would like to
call.

If you want, you can get more complicated and set up multiple response
buttons with different titles calling different phone numbers.  If you
do, make sure you leave one button with no PhoneCode setting that you
can use to close the response button menu without calling anybody.

*******************************************************************
Q:
Cadpage started working after update but has stopped working again. Did they change things again?

Quite probably.  But I can't tell until I see what the pages look like now.

If Cadpage is still picking them up, you can long press the call and
select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  If Cadpage is not picking
up the call, using the Email the Developer feature right after Cadpage
fails to pick up a call will usually get it to us.

A: The Map feature is the only thing that is really unique to Cadpage.  If
you are not using that then there are other, far cheaper, apps that will
monitor and alert you about incoming text messages.

If you do have any pages that are not mapping, long press the call and
select Report Problem to send it to us.  We will see what we can do with it.

If Cadpage fails to pick up something that you think it should, used the
Email the Developer feature to send us an email ASAP.  The generated
email includes technical information about the last text messages, which
I can hopefully use to identify why Cadpage did not pick it up.

A feature to allow alert notifications to be customized by a schedule or
by call type is one of the most often requested new features.  I really
hope to implement it someday, but just keeping up with text parsing is a
full time job that doesn't leave much time to work on new Cadpage
features.  We will probably get it done someday, but it isn't going to
be any time soon.  You might want to look into getting your pages
through Active911.com.  They do have scheduling and filtering
capabilities.  They only control whether or not you get pages, there
still is no way to customize different alerts for different pages, but
it might suit your needs.  Cadpage is free if you are getting pages from
Active911.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

****************************************************************************
Q:
> I do not have the ability to see other responders in real time. Is this a

A:

Alas, that feature is only available for the Active911 IPhone app.  We are still trying to think of ways to implement that feature in Cadpage, but the technical challenges are formidable.

****************************************************************************
Q: Will not map the call when it comes across as a general alert

A: Could you please long press all of the calls reporting as general alerts
and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.

**************************************************************************
Q: > I am receiving pages well after the calls come out (30-60 min). I am not
> sure if it's a cadpage or dispatch problem but others that have the app
> are having the same problem.

A: This is being reported fairly often recently.  You are getting text
pages, and the only reason Cadpage alerting will be delayed for text
pages is because the messages are just not arriving at your device in a
timely fashion.  If you want to prove this, go into Cadpage Additional
Settings and check the box labeled "Pass Calls through to SMS Client".
With that set, all calls will be passed to your message inbox in
addition to alerting Cadpage and you can confirm the extent to which the
messages are delayed.

According to the message timestamps, it took a bit over 5 seconds for
the carrier to deliver this call to you, which would imply that the
delay was introduced by the dispatch messaging service.  But this should
not be considered hard proof, I have some suspicions that carriers are
holding messages in a system queue for some reason and that the total
delay is not represented by this number.

You can also try sending yourself text messages when these delays are
observed to see if those messages are also being delayed.  But when it
comes down to it, about the only thing you can really do is complain to
the carrier and/or dispatch service about the delays.

It might be worth considering switching to another messaging service.
CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com are reasonably priced and can push
pages to your device without relying on text messaging and will probably
fix your delay problem.  Unless the dispatch center is slow getting the
pages out, in which case they have logs to prove that and some clout to
take the issue up with dispatch IT people.  And Cadpage doesn't bug you
about paying for a subscription when you are getting direct pages from them.

Take care,
-Ken

***************************************************************

*************************************************************

Sorry, we do not support Windows phones.  If you know of a developer who
would like to port Cadpage to Windows phones, we would be happy to help
any way that we can.

**************************************************************

The basic problem is that all dispatch centers have a different way of
formatting their text pages.  Which a specific text parser has to be
written for each one.  Since this parser is dedicated to handling only
pages from this dispatch center, it can be very specific about pulling
the correct information out of each message.  The downside is that we
need a lot of these parsers, getting close to 800 now, and they have to
be continuously updated to keep up with changes dispatch centers make to
how the pages are formatted.  Which is what makes Cadpage such a high
maintenance (read expensive) app.

When we don't have a specific location parser to handle your pages, the
only way you can use Cadpage is with one of the general location
parsers.  These parsers don't know the specifics of the pages they have
to handle, so look at everything and make general informed guesses at
where the needed information can be found.  Because they lack this
specific knowledge, the won't always get the correct information, and
are more likely to fail completely that a location specific parser.
While the general parsers are large and complicated, some of my best
work really, they are rather static and almost never need to be updated.
 Because they are not as reliable as a location specific parser.  And
because their total maintenance costs are relatively low, we have chosen
to not try to collect from users until we have a location specific
parser they can use.

Hope that all makes sense,
-Ken

You may continue with the SPONSORed Cadpage by using the General location setting and set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.

*********************************************************************************
Well, when you go into Cadpage, you probably have a list of past calls, named Call History.

You can send us any number of these dispatch messages by long pressing the call from the Call History list.  Then select Report Problem from the menu list, and Email the Developer.  That generates an email to us with details of the call.

*******************************************************************************
Q:I gather that it is still filtering the
pages add they come into our phones but the location settings help parse
out and display the page properly. Am I reading that correctly?

A: The location setting only tells Cadpage how the expected text page is
formmatted so we know how to parse information from it.  Usually all of
the departments served by one dispatch center use the same text page
format, so the same location will work for all departments dispatched by
that center.  It is a common misconception that setting a particular
location is all that you have to do to start receiving pages from that
center.  As explaned before, it is the dispatch center/message service
that decides which pages will be sent to your device, the location just
tells Cadpage how to interpret those pages.

We do not support the sending of these confidential dispatch messages to social media like Twitter.  It would not be professional, or courteous to the patients we serve.

Thanks for your inquiry,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

unable to delete calls

A --

You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are
displayed in bold text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a
(Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the
additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened
calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,

sometime, but right now we still are not sure how best to implement that.

*********************************************************************************

Cadpage does not determine who sends you pages, that has to be arranged
with someone else.  The Cadpage location settings merely tell Cadpage
how to process pages that you have already arranged to have sent to your
phone.

If you are a member of a fire department or other emergency response
organization, there is someone in your department who can usually get
pages sent to your phone.  You just have to ask around to see who that
is.  If you are not a member of an emergency response organization,
Cadpage will be of little use to you.

Cadpage (free) v1.4.42

The free version of Cadpage you are currently running is unsupported. And lacks the basic support reporting features I need to figure out what is wrong.

You need to install the regular version of Cadpage available from the Google Play Store.  Then long press the calls that are not mapping and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.  The regular version is free for the first 30 days.  If you are really lucky, you will be able to switch back to the free/unsupported version after we figure out what is wrong.  Or you can ask us for a free hardship subscription.

Take care,

Q: The Cadpage app will not allow me clear all messages

A:  You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are displayed in bold text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a (Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

Occasionally users end up with call history filled with unopened calls.  At which point Cadpage starts deleting calls as soon as you open them.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened calls without having to open them first.

*************************************************************************************
Q:  I was wondering why their is only notification sounds that are the same notification sounds that are the default sounds of android phone whereas
the iPhone has notifications that sound like a department pager etc that are through cad page


A: Different environments.  From what I understand, the IOS environment forces developers to provide your own notification sounds and makes it difficult to use system sponsored oens.  The Android environment makes it difficult
 to provide your own notification sounds and easy to use the system predefined ones.  I was thinking of adding an option to install all of the Active911 notification sounds in the Android system where they would be available
 to everyone.  But like so many other things I just don't have time to get to it.

Have fun,

Q:  Whenever I get a call via cadpage it says "general alert" and nothing else.
> No map / location or call type. This seems to only be happening on the

A:  Can you pick some of the calls that this is happening to, long press them and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.

Take care,
-Ken
************************************************************************************
Q:  I wanted to confirm that I have this app configured correctly. I am get alerts that are not corresponding with my dept pager and think something may be wrong?

A: Nothing you do with Cadpage settings does anything to determine what pages get sent to your phone.  Someone in your department sets up the department distribution list to send department alerts to your phone number.  It sounds like they might have set you up on the wrong list. You should find someone in your department to talk to about it.

Good luck
-Ken

************************************************************************************
Q:  Is there any way to make cadpage receive email pages?

A: Not directly, for a variety of complicated technical reasons, Cadpage
support for emailed alerts is just not going to happen.

There are indirect ways to make this happen.  The best is to sign up
with the Active911.com messaging service.  They can take your email
alerts and push them to Cadpage without relying on text messages, which
avoids a lot of problems.

Alternatively, all cell network vendors maintain email address that will
turn email into SMS or MMS text messages.  You can either forward or
direct your email alerts to these addresses.

For Verizon, the email address are
NNNNNNNNNN@vtext.com for text messages and
NNNNNNNNNN@vzwpix.com for MMS messages

Other vendors have different gateway addresses.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

************************************************************************************
not refunding

Please allow me to explain the fee for our Cadpage app.  Because it is a high maintenance app, continually in development, our $9.99 fee is a per-year subscription.  You have not purchased the app, but I did find your subscription payment of ____________.  You apparently used Cadpage for over 8 months.

Also, when you pay through Google Play Store, Google takes 30% of that $9.99. With Google, we cannot do partial refunds, so we would be losing out of most of our $7 gain.

Therefore our policy is to refund subscriptions 6 months old or less.
I regret to say that we will not refund your $9.99 payment, but if you are really in a hardship situation, please let us know.

Thanks for your support and your understanding,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

************************************************************************************
multiple departements or agencies

Cadpage can handle multiple departments easily enough.

If your departments support text pages, you have to make arrangements to have their text pages sent to your phone.  Then just select the appropriate location(s) in Cadpage to cover your text page department.

If your departments get pages through Active911, it is a simple matter to have your device added to the  device lists for both departments.

Take care,
Jean, Asssistant to Ken Corbin


***********************************************************************************
Explanation of CodeMessaging and Active911

Cadpage, as a standalone app, has no addition features beyond what you
get during the evaluation demo.  And no additional costs beyond the
regular $9.99/year subscription fee.

If you use CodeMessaging.net or Active911.com as your message forwarding
service, they will provide additional features.  Both can push pages to
Cadpage without relying on text messaging, which eliminates any text
message fees and length limits.  CodeMessaging will keep track of and
report responder status.  Active911 will track and report bot responder
status and position.  These are features which are really providing by
the forwarding service, but Cadpage supports their use.

Using either agency will allow your IPhone users to run Cadpage like
apps.  Restrictions imposed by the IOS system prevent IPhone apps from
intercepting text pages the way Cadpage/Android does.  The only way to
use a Cadpage like app on an IOS device is if one of those two services
can push pages to it.

And Cadpage itself is free if you are getting direct pages from either
service.

Have a nice day,

compare Active911 for iPhone and Android Cadpage

Cadpage/Android does not currently have the ability to display a map
showing the locations of other responders.  This is a known issue, we
are working with Active911 to resolve it somehow, but there are a lot of
technical issues that need to be solved.

That was, to my knowledge, the only feature of the Active911 IPhone app
that Cadpage/Android does not support.

********************************************************************************
General message about Android devices that support Cadpage


Cadpage works on pretty much all Android devices.  It can work with
pretty much all dispatch page messages, but supporting the requires some
work on both of our parts.

The free version of Cadpage lacks the support features needed to get
things working.  You will have to uninstall it and install the regular
Cadpage version from Google Play Store.  It does not cost anything to
install.  And it will run for 30 days before asking you to pay anything.
 And there are and always will be ways to continue running it
indefinitely without having to pay anything.

Once you have that set up, wait until you get some calls.  If Cadpage
picks up your calls, long press the call and select "Report Problem" to
send it to us.  If it does not, use the Email the Developer setting to
generate an email to us.  Either option should include information about
your current settings and the page message that I need to figure out
what needs to be done.

***********************************************************************************
Security issues

Cadpage does not do anything to determine what pages are sent to what
phones.  It only displays the page information that is sent to your
phone.  Dispatch or the messaging service that dispatch uses is
responsible for determining which pages are sent to where.

Usually you dispatch Admin or someone in your department is responsible
for maintaining a list of which phone numbers/devices should be sent
your department pages.  There are always some kind of security
provisions to ensure that that list can not be altered by unauthorized
persons.

Given that, there have been cases where unauthorized citizens have ended
up receiving department pages.  These fall into both categories, but
involve failures on the part of the department IT people.

1) There are one and possibly more individuals on the east coast who
have used good old fashioned social engineering tactics to convince the
device admins to add them to the department distribution lists.  There
need to be procedures and policies in place to confirm the identity of
anyone asking to be included in the dispatch page distribution list.

2) Occasionally, we here from unhappy private citizens who have just
gotten a new cell phone and are being sent dispatch alerts from some
unknown source.  What happens is someone who was initially authorized to
receive dispatch pages changed their cell phone number, and the old
number was eventually reassigned to a new user getting a new phone
number.  The device admins need to be careful about cleaning up the list
when members leave the department or change phone numbers.

****************************************************************************
General Help Message

I try really hard to avoid getting into phone support.  There are only
two of us working on Cadpage and it would take too much of my time.

Everything about your phone setup and the Active911 phone setup looks
fine.  If you are receiving Cadpage pages that are not right somehow,
long press them and select "Report Problem" to send them to us.

If you are not getting pages, get whoever sets up your device with
Active911 to use the Active911 web page to send a test message to your
phone.

If you do get the test page, but still do not receive real dispatch
alerts, then something about your Active911 settings is preventing them
from sending dispatch pages to you.  If your department Active911
administrator cannot figure out what that is, try contacting Active911
support for help.

If the test message does not arrive in a timely manner, go into Cadpage
settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct Paging
We do not know why, but doing this usually fixes the problem.

Take care,
****************************************************************************

notification when phone is muted

Go into Notification settings and check the box
labeled, "Override Notifications.  It is not as flexible as the regular
notificiaton process.  But it does alert you when the phone is muted.

Take care,

****************************************************************************
mile markers
Q: The app does not recognize this as mm 3.3. Is it possible to do so?

A: It would not help if we did.  We use Google to generate the maps, and
one thing Google does not understand is highway mile markers.

There is a solution.  If you can generate a table of GPS coordinates for
highway mile markers in your district, we can use that to map calls to
the  mile markers.  Ideally you should have two sets of coordinates for
each Interstate mile marker, one for eastbound and another for westbound
lanes.

Take care,
-Ken
**********************************************
Q:How do I register through I am responding?

A: We do not have any direct contacts with IamResponding.  Basically,
someone in your department arranges to have them forward dispatch pages
as text messages to your phone.  Once you are getting those text pages,
Cadpage can be configured to process them.  IamResponding has a feature
where you can indicate your responding status by phoning one or more
special phone numbers.  Cadpage can be configured to call those numbers
when you press a predefined response button.

Take care,
-Ken

********************************************************
Q:How do you long press calls?

A: Long press is a techie term for basically touch and hold.

If you view the Cadpage call history screen, you can select and open any
call by just touching it.  If you touch an item and hold it for a second
or two, an option menu will pop up.  Report Problem is one of the
options.  Selecting it brings up a dialog box asking if you want to send
us an email.  Pressing the yes button fires off an email request to your
Email client to generate an email that will be prefilled with lots of
technical information about that call.

Hope that all makes sense
-Ken
*******************************************************************
Q The clear all button only clears one call at a time 9nly after you've selected it.

A: You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are
displayed in bold text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have a
(Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

Occasionally users end up with call history filled with unopened calls.
 At which point Cadpage starts deleting calls as soon as you open them.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the
additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened
calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,
-Ken

*********************************************************************
Q: one department used Active911, another does not

A:It looks like you have an Active911 subscription sponsored by
Mooresville Rescue Squad Inc.  If you register Cadpage with the device
number and and activation code that they can provide, two things will happen
1) You will start getting direct pages for Mooresville Rescue
2) Cadpage will stop asking you to purchase a subscription

If you do not want to get pages from Mooresville Rescue, you can log in
to the Active911.com web site and set your duty status to off.  Cadpage
will remain free for use as long as it is registered with the Active911
agency.  It looks like that is a fringe benefit of working for
Mooorseville Rescue.

While you are at it, you could set up Active911 agencies for the two
volunteer departments.  If they have the capability of sending text
pages to you, they can just as easily send them through Active911.  That
would require two separate subscriptions with Active911 that might cost
more $$$.  Active911 has a free subscription status for low volume
volunteer departments, you would have to contact them for the details.

Hope that all makes sense,
-Ken

***********************************************************************
Messages coming in as General alerts

The means that the location parser you have selected is not recognizing
the message as a dispatch page.  If you long press some of the general
alerts you are getting and select "Report Problem" to send them to us,
we will see what we have to do to fix things.

Take care,
-Ken
***********************************************************************
re=used phone number

Cadpage does send pages or messages to anyone.  The app we publish only
processes text pages from local emergency services that are sent to your
phone.

My guess is that you just got a new phone, or new phone number, and had
the bad luck to be assigned a phone number that is being sent dispatch
pages because it was previously assigned to a emergency dispatch
responder.  What you need to do is contact the agency that is sending
you those pages and ask them to stop.

If you recognize the dispatch addresses as local area addresses, the
agency you need to contact is your local fire department.  Just call
them and explain what is happening.  They will take you off their
distribution list pronto.

If you do not recognize the dispatch addresses, we may be able to help
you.  We do have an extensive collection of dispatch pages from across
the country.  If you forward a couple of them to us at
support@cadpage.org, we may be able to identify the agency that is
sending them.  If you do this, please include your name and/or email
address.  We sometimes have trouble matching forwarded texts messages
with your emails.

Take care,
-Ken
*************************************************************************
download updates


Android app updates are done through the Goggle Play store.  If you wait
a day or so it will usually notify you when an update is avaiable, or
automatically  install it.

If you got into Cadpage Settings and click the "Write a Cadpage Review"
button, it will take to the Play Store page for Cadpage, where you can
install any available updates as well as write a Cadpage review.

***************************************************************************
BASIC INFO

In it's basic form, Cadpage intercepts SMS text messages sent to an
Android phone, determines if they look like pages from a CAD dispatch
system, and if so, parses the information from the text and displays it
in a standard form.  When requested, we use the incident address to
display the incident location on a  map, and from their users can
request navigation guidance to the incident.

Dispatch centers have been sending SMS text pages to emergency
responders for years.  They do so without any awareness that Cadpage is
out there trying to process their pages.  The short story is, if you can
configure your CAD system to send text messages to subscribers, or more
commonly to send an SMTP (email) message to a messaging service who will
forward the page information to subscribers, than your system will work
with Cadpage.

There are two messaging services (CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com)
that can push your page information to Cadpage without using relying on
text messages.  This is often more reliable, and avoids problems with
long pages getting truncated because they are over the maximum limit for
text messages.  Using one of these services also your users to run
Cadpage on Android tablets that cannot receive SMS text messages, or on
IOS devices where the environment does not permit apps to intercept text
messages.

Cadpage was designed to serve Fire, EMS, and Police responders, but it
can also be used for public service and utility crews.  Any operation
that sends text messages that contain some kind of response or service
address will probably find it useful.

Hope that is useful!  Feel free to contact us if you have any more
questions.

Have a nice day,
-Ken
*************************************************************************
Q: Can you do a test page some time today?

A: You, or your department's Active911 administrator, can send yourself a
text page from the Active911.com website.  Go to the member information area and
select the device tab.  Beside each configured device there is a row of
three icons.  The middle one is used to send that device a text message.

Connect back to Cadpage with Active911

To reconnect Cadpage to Active911, you have to open the Cadpage Settings
and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This brings up a web page where you have to enter your device number and
activation code which is ____________.

*************************************************************************

We distribute the Cadpage app for Android phones.  Active911 is a
different organization with their own support system.  It is Active911
that maintains and displays the responder and custom Map information.
That information is available on the Active911 IPhone app, and the new
Active911 Android app.  It is not and never has been available with our
Cadpage app.

Cadpage should allow you to map the location of your incidents, we just
can't add responder and hydrant locations to those maps.  If you are
getting pages that are not mapping correctly, long press them and select
"Report Problem" to send them to us.

**************************************************************************
Active911 Android app

Generally you need one Active911 device code per device.  That device can be used for either
Cadpage or Active911 apps on either Android or IOS phones.   But it can
only be used for one app/phone combination at a time.  Usually that is
enough, it was expected that users will user either Cadpage or Active911
apps on their phones, but not both.

You can switch the device code back and forth between the Active911 and
Cadpage apps at will.  To switch back to Cadpage, just register the
Cadpage with Active911 the way you originally did
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
and enter the device code which is __________________.  To switch from Cadpage
back to Active911, open the Active911 app settings, and change the
device code to something invalid.  Then change it back to ____________.

You can use one device code to receive pages from any number of
Active911 agencies.  If you are using the Cadpage app, you can also set
it up to receive text pages from other departments in addition to the
pages you get through Active911.

Does that cover what you need?
***************************************************************************
late calls

Can you long press some of the calls that are coming in late and select
"Report Problem" to send them to us?

***************************************************************************
switch from Active911 Android app

Apparently, your department has paid for Active911, and your device is currently registered to use the Active911 Android app. Since that system is in place, your pages will no longer be sent to the Cadpage app.

If you want to switch back to using Cadpage instead of the Active911 app, you need to re-register Cadpage with Active911.
To do that, go into Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Unregister > Register
then enter your device code: ________________.

If things still do not work, or if generated test messages do not make
it to your device, use the Email the Developer feature to send us
another email.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

********************************************************************************

You have to register the Active911 app with their servers.  To do that,

If you want to switch back to using Cadpage at some future time, open
Cadpage settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
and enter the same device activation code.

A: Cadpage will be useful for any organization or agency that can send text
messages containing some kind of incident address to its members
notifying them when some event happens.

Cadpage takes care of what happens when those text messages are received
on your phone.  You have to set up the messaging system that creates
those text messages.  This is not that hard to do.  There are a lot of
services that allow you to send one email to a specific address and have
it be relayed as text messages to a list of group subscribers.

In particular, there are two such services, Codemessaging.net and
Active911.com, that can push pages to Cadpage without relying on text
messages.  Which has some advantages such as allowing Cadpage to work on
Android tablets that can not process text messages.

Take care,


**************************************************************************

Using Cadpage and Active911 is not an either/or proposition.  We
strongly encourage, and a lot of users are very happy, using the Cadpage
Android app with the Active911 message service.

Cadpage can receive what we call direct pages from Active911.  These are
pages delivered through the data comm networks, just like they are to
the Active911 Android app.  Or it can receive regular text pages which
are dispatch pages delivered as SMS text messages.  If you have Cadapge
set up to receive direct pages from Active911, or CodeMessaging.net,
then there is no charge for using Cadpage.

If you want to register Cadpage with Active911, go into Cadpage settings
and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.net > Register
That takes you to a web page where you have to enter the Active911
activation code, which in your case is ___________

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``

In general, Cadpage and the Active911 app perform the same function and
you only need to install one of them.  If you register Cadpage with
Active911, the alerts will stop coming to the Active911 app.  If you
register the Active911 app with their server, alerts will stop coming to
Cadpage.

If you really want to, it is possible to use both apps on the same
phone.  Basically, you register Active911 first, then register Cadpage.
 Cadpage gets the initial alert, but when you run Active911 (which you
can do directly from Cadpage) it will load and display the same alert
information.


************************************************************************
General Location

The general
location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are
structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.
 To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a
location setting that will know more about your specific message format
and can get a lot more information from it.

*****************************************************************************
Installing updates

Most likely it was automatically installed already.  If not, you install
the update with Google Play Store.  Or go into Cadpage settings and
select "Write a Cadpage Review" which takes you directly to the Play
Store page where you can update Cadpage.

******************************************************************************

As of Android 4.4, Cadpage no longer has the ability to prevent text
pages from showing up in your default message app inbox.  That "feature"
was eliminated because it was being grossly abused by other third party
messaging apps.

Cadpage can still process incoming text pages and and show an alert when
they are recognized as dispatch pages.  If it is not doing that, then
something else has probably changed.  See if you can use this email the
developer feature to send us an email right after Cadpage fails to pick
up a page.

The above comments apply to dispatch alerts that are received as SMS
text messages.  The  most recent alert reported here was a direct page
from Active911 for Jackson County.  Direct pages are not SMS messages,
they are not affected by anything done in Android 4.4, and they can not
possibly appear in your SMS message inbox.  I'm not sure quite what your
situation is, are you receiving direct pages from one agency and text
pages from a different agency?

Take care, !

*******************************************************************************
Hi folks,

I just found out about your service from someone in Dare County, NC.
And I believe we can offer a service that you will find extremely useful.

From what I can tell, you receive dispatch pages from a variety of
dispatch centers running all kinds of different CAD software.  Your
technical people must already run into the unpleasant reality which is
that there is no standard message protocol among dispatch centers.
Pretty much every dispatch center has their own text page format, and
requires a dedicated message parser to extract the information you need
to report and map the incident location.

Cadpage is a fairly simple Android app that is designed to check
incoming text messages, identify dispatch page alerts, and parse the
call and address information from those alerts and use it to alert the
user, who can then request a map and directions to the incident
location.  We ran into the lack of dispatch notice standardization
problem 3 years ago.  We responded by constructing a library of over 800
dispatch page parsers to handle messages from dispatch centers all over
the country.  While that library is directly integrated with the Cadpage
app running on Android devices, it can also be run as a standalone Java
library on your servers.  And in that mode, it can be used to parse
pages from all of our currently supported dispatch centers.

The Cadpage parsing library is an open source project distributed under
a GPLv3 license.  We do not charge users for using the library.  We do
charge for ongoing maintenance.  And between keeping up with changes to
existing page formats and implementing new parsers as needed, there is a
awful lot of maintenance required.  But if you do you own maintenance,
using your own developers to keep up with the parser changes and new
parsers required for your customers, then you do not have to pay us
anything.  The "price" is that you are paying your developers to work on
a parsing library that can, and will, be shared with some of your
competitors.  But those competitors are in the same boat.

If your technical people are interested, the entire Cadpage project w/
source code is hosted at https://code.google.com/p/cadpage.

The GPLv3 license is a holdover from the days when we base the initial
Cadpage app on code from another GPLv3 licensed project.  It really
isn't appropriate for library running on a server, and there are plans
to change the project license to an LGPLv3 license, with the additional

Prior to Android 4.4, apps have the ability to register for SMS messages at
a higher than normal priority.  This lets them get a first look at SMS
pages and, if it turns out to be something they need to process, block
those messages from appearing in the default messaging app.  Cadpage has
made use of this capability, as have a number of security and theft
prevention apps.

Unfortunately, a number of third party messaging apps, Handcent and Go
SMS in particular, have misused this feature to grab the highest
possibly priority slot, intercept all text messages, and block them from
being received by competing messaging apps.  This has been a major
problem for Cadpage, and other messaging app developers which have been
pretty much forced to adopt the same practice in self defense.  The most
recent version of Google Hangouts has started doing this as well.

In Android 4.4, the rules all change to eliminate this nonsense.  The
user gets to specify one default messaging app, that app always gets the
text pages, and only that app has access to the message database and
only that app can send SMS messages.  Other apps, such as Cadpage, can
continue to receive SMS messages, but will no longer be able to block
them from going to any other apps.

The good news is that Cadpage will continue to function under Android
4.4.  The bad news is that we will no longer be able to block dispatch
pages from appearing in your default message inbox.  The best you can do
is use a blacklisting feature in the default message app to prevent
dispatch pages from appearing there.

And, of course, if Cadpage is getting direct pages from
Codemessaging.net or Active911.com, nothing will change.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

RENEWAL -- Department sponsorships

I noticed that the Department-Sponsored Cadpage subcriptions for West Valley VFD is coming up for a renewal.  Officially, your subscriptions of 1-12-13. will expire on 1-12-14.

You may certainly use the Cadpage app long after the expiration date, if you do not install a newer update of the app, or change phones or email addresses.

Please let me know if you would like to extend the Cadpage subscriptions for your department.

Thanks so much for your support.

deleting call history

You can't delete unopened calls or locked calls.  Unopened calls are
displayed as yellow text and can be opened manually.  Locked calls have
a (Locked) indicator and can be unlocked through the long press option menu.

Occasionally users end up with call history filled with unopened calls.
 At which point Cadpage starts deleting calls as soon as you open them.
 This kind of sounds like what happened to you.

If you are having a lot of unopened calls, there is an option in the
additional settings that you can check to allow you to delete unopened
calls without having to open them first.

Hope that helps,

**************************************************************************
Android 4.3

We know this is going to happen with Android 4.4.  But you are the
second person reporting it happening with Android 4.3.  Which makes me
wonder if Google was trying to port some of their new logic back into 4.3.

At 4.3 and below this happens for one of two reasons.  First, Dispatch
may have suddenly decided to start sending you MMS pages instead of SMS
text pages.  Not likely, but something that should be checked on.  You
can long press any of the dispatch pages you have in your message inbox
and select message details or something similar that will should you the
actual message type.

The more common reason is that a message app is grabbing the top slot in
the message receive queue so no other app can block messages coming to
them.  There have been a number of 3rd party message apps that started
doing this a couple years ago.  More and more publishers of other
message apps have found it necessary to adopt the same practice in self
defense.  The situation is getting intolerable, which is what led Google
to change the rules in 4.4.

The other guy reporting this said it happened when he got an update to
the stock Samsung message app.  I am running a Samsung message app and
have not observed that behavior, at least not yet.  What message app is
not letting Cadpage block messages to it?

For now, it is still possible to get Cadpage to work as intended by
installing a different message app.  But in the long run, the ability
for one app to block messages from getting to the user designated
default message app is just going to go away.  Options are going to be
1) learn to live with it
2) use the message app blacklist feature to block pages from appearing there
3) switch to using a direct paging vendor (currently CodeMessaging.net
or Active911.com) to deliver pages to Cadpage.

Take care,

stop automatic updates

There are two ways.  To turn off auto updates globally, open the Google
Play Store app, select settings, and change the "Auto-update apps"
setting to no auto update apps.  I've been using that setting for years,
it works quite well.

To turn off auto updates for individual apps, open the Play Store page
for that specific apps, then press settings and change the "Auto-update"
setting.  That is relatively new and I have not tried it myself.  There
were reports that manually selecting "Update All" would update apps that
you specifically requested not be updated.  But that has supposedly been
fixed.

This will not help if you have already installed a version of Cadpage
published after the subscription expiration date.  To fix that, you need
to revert back to an earlier version of Cadpage.  I always keep a one
week old version of cadpage on our download page at
http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage as cadpage-old.apk.  The page
has instructions on how to install it.  See if that gets you back before
the expiration date.  If it does not, let us know and I can rebuild an
old Cadpage release from any date that you need.

***************************************************************************

Using Cadpage and Active911

Next question, do you want to use Cadpage with Active911, or get text
messages.  Or both, if you don't mind getting duplicate alerts and have
some interest in determining which is getting pages to you faster.

To enable direct pages from Active911 (to Cadpage), open Cadpage
Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Register
This will take you to a web page where you need to enter your Active911
device Activation code, which is ________________.

To enable text pages, you have to get dispatch text alerts sent to your
phone.  This isn't something you do in Cadpage.  There is someone in
your department that is responsible for getting dispatch pages sent to
member phones.  You need to find that person and have them start getting
dispatch alerts sent to your phone.

Cadpage will probably start picking up those alerts automatically.  If
it does not, use the Email the Developer feature to send us another
Email right after Cadpage fails to pick up one of your pages.

********************************************************************************
expiration; keep using Cadpage; no further payment

It looks like you have a subscription paid through ___________,  Which
basically means you have already paid for any and all Cadpage releases
up to that date.

Once that subscription expires, you can run the Cadpage version released
on or before the expiration date indefinitely.  But if you install a new
version published after that date, Cadpage will start asking you for
money again.

*****************************************************************************
Two different dispatch centers

First, you have to get both departments to send dispatch alerts to your
phone.  There should be someone at both departments who can set this up
for you.

If both departments are dispatched from the same 911 center, that
Cadpage should process both of them without any difficulty.  If they are
dispatched from different centers, it may be necessary to specify
multiple location as the Cadpage current location.  You can do this by
pressing the Select Multiple Locations item in the Location Settings.

*****************************************************************************
using Active911 and Cadpage


Currently, you have the Active911 Android app registered with Active911
servers.  When you register the Active911 app, pages will stop coming to
Cadpage.  When you register Cadpage with Active911, pages will stop
coming to the Active911 app.  Pages can only be pushed to one app at a time.

It is possible to run both apps together by registering Active911 first,
then switching to Cadpage.  The alerts are pushed to Cadpage and Cadpage
only, but when you launch the Active911 app, it will query the Active911
servers and update its call information.  There are some new Cadpage
features that make that easier.  One is a new Settings item "Cadpage and
Active911 apps" explaining how to set that up.

*******************************************************************************
Well, there are several things to consider:
1.  Is your phone an Android device?  Our Cadpage app is for Android devices only.  If you are using an iPhone, you may have paid for Cadpage For IOS.  For support for that, please contact Jesse at support@apprhythmia.com.

2.  If your phone is Android and you have installed Cadpage, make sure you are getting text pages sent to your phone when a call is toned out.  If you are not, talk to someone in your department about getting that set up.

Next, go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or work.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting.  Set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support.

3.  If you paid for Active911, a messaging service, you will need to register your phone.

Please contact us again if you still have difficulties.  Please use the Cadpage app to send an email:  Select Settings, then Email the Developer with configuration information.

**************************************************************************************

Welcome to Cadpage!

Please note that our Cadpage app is for Android devices only.  You'll need another option if you have an iPhone or Windows phone.

You can download Cadpage from our website at http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage/
or search for Cadpage at the Google Play Store.

The intended purpose of Cadpage is to support emergency responders who get text pages from a central dispatch center when they are asked to respond to an emergency.  Cadpage takes those pages, displays the information from them, and gives the user the option to bring up a Google map showing the location of the incident.Then they can ask for directions to that location.

First, make sure you are getting text pages sent to your phone when a call is toned out.  If you are not, talk to someone in your department about getting that set up.

Next, go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or work. We do have Warren County, NY as one of our supported locations.

Cadpage will give you a free 30-day DEMO.  It is the same great app as the "pro" version, and after your DEMO expires, there are some payment options.  A one-year subscription to Cadpage is $9.99.

Let's see how the DEMO goes first before we tackle the payment.

Please contact us again if you still have difficulties or questions concerning Cadpage.

Take care,

change phone number

As long as you keep the same email account on your new phone, any
Cadpage payment status should carry over automatically.

Changing the phone number might be more of a problem.  If you are
getting text dispatch alerts, you need to talk to someone in your
department about switching the alert to your new phone number.

If you are getting direct pages from CodeMessaging or Active911, all you
need to do is register your new phone with the paging service.

*************************************************************************
GETTING STARTED - want to try

Cadpage is a great app, but before we give you a whole year for free, let's make sure it works for you. Cadpage is available for a free 30-day DEMO from Google Play Store. It is the same great app, just limited in time before it requests payment.

Cadpage is an Android app that Users can install on Android phones. If your dispatch center can send text alerts to department member phones when a call is dispatched, Cadpage can intercept those text alerts, display its own alert screen, and then show the incident location on a map and/or generate turn-by-turn directions to the scene.

Cadpage works on all Android versions from 2.1 on up.

After installation of the app, there are 2 main things to get Cadpage up and running:

First, make sure you are getting text pages sent to your phone when a call is toned out. If you are not, talk to someone in your department about getting that set up.

If dispatch lacks the ability to send dispatch text alerts, all is not
lost. I would investigate contracting with CodeMessaging.net or
Active911.com to provide messaging services for your dispatch center.

Next, go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or work. If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting. Set the From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages. That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are waiting for full location support.

When you have determined that Cadpage works effectively for you, please contact us again for your free one-year subscription.

*************************************************************************************************************
getting started - basics

Cadpage is not really a service.  Cadpage is an Android app that
users can install on Android phones.  If your dispatch center can send
text alerts to department member phones when a call is dispatched,
Cadpage can intercept those text alerts, display its own alert screen,
and then show the incident location on a map and/or generate turn-by-turn directions to the scene.

Cadpage works on all Android versions from 2.1 on up.

So the first requirement is that dispatch has to have the ability to
send dispatch text alerts to user cell phones.  If they are already
doing that, your members can use Cadpage.

If dispatch lacks the ability to send dispatch text alerts, all is not
lost.  I would investigate contracting with CodeMessaging.net or
Active911.com to provide messaging services for your dispatch center.
When using one of them, dispatch only needs to send a single SMTP
(email) message to the service and they take care of distributing it to
the people who need to get it.  Both of these services can push alerts
directly to Cadpage without relying on text messaging.

_________________ is not currently one of our supported locations, which
means Cadpage does not know how to interpret the pages that it receives
from your dispatch center.  That is easy to fix.  All someone, anyone,
needs to do is send us some information about your text alerts.

To add a new location we need 5-10 sample text messages from your
dispatch.  Please include what County/City/Company these pages are for
so we can place it in the right grouping. Please try to include 1-2
calls with intersections so we can parse those correctly. Include any
details you can regarding how the messages are formatted. If possible
please include what email the messages come from.

We also need to know what agency is generating these messages and some
idea of what other departments receive the same message formats.  If you
can identify the CAD software that is sending your text pages that would
help a lot.

All of this needs to be emailed to our main support address:
support@cadpage.org.  If the messages are already in Cadpage call
history, long press each call and select "Report Problem" to send them
to us.  Otherwise, you can forward text messages to that address, or
copy and paste them into a regular email or generate an email in Cadpage
which will include the last text message.  Once we have this information
we can add the location to the list.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting and set the
From: filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text
messages.  That will usually give you some degree of functionality while
you are waiting for full location support.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

That is basically all that you need to do to get started.  Once things
are up and running, you may want to consider whether your department
and/or dispatch center want to sponsor Cadpage for their members.  We
normally expect end users to purchase a $9.99 annual subscription for
Cadpage after using it for 30 days.  But if departments want to sponsor
Cadpage for their members we give them a discounted $7/user rate.
Dispatch centers get a $5/user rate.  Or if you choose to use, and pay
for CodeMessaging or Active911 services, Cadpage is free for the end
users.  We get a portion of what you pay them.

***************************************************************************

When the system comes online, it  will be included in a regular Cadpage
release and be prominently listed in the displayed change log for that
release.
***************************************************************************


Thank you for your interest in adding Cadpage to your dispatch
operations.  But we probably are not the people you need to be talking
to.  Cadpage is an app running on Android smartphones that listens for
incoming text messages that look like dispatch generated text alerts and
displays the information in those text alerts to the user.  We do not
have anything that you can install or interface to with your dispatch
software.

If your current CAD system already has the ability to send text alerts
to your emergency responders, those responders can use Cadpage to
process those text alerts and nothing more needs to be done.  If it does
not, you need to link your software with a messaging service that can
take the SMTP message that your CAD system can probably generate when a
call is dispatched and forward it as a text message to responders.  As
before, Cadpage will process these text messages and display the alert.

There are many dispatch services across the country that can be used.
Cadpage has a special relationship with two of these.  CodeMessaging.net
and Active911.com can push your alerts to Cadpage devices through the
internet data network without relying on SMS text messages.  This has a
number of advantages of text messaging, it avoid onerous SMS text
messaging fees and problems with alerts being truncated because the
exceed the maximum length for text messages.  And it allows Cadpage to
be used on Android tablets that can not receive regular text messages.

CodeMessaging.net and/or Active911.com are the organizations that you
probably want to approach about handling your dispatch alerts.  Both can
be contacted at their respective web sites.  Both are highly recommended.

Have a nice day,
-Ken
****************************************************************
Running Cadpage on a Tablet

There are two problems here.

First we need to get Cadpage to recognize your old payment status on the
new tablet.  This should happen automatically if you set up the tablet
with same email address you used for your old phone.  More specifically,
the payment status should transfer over if Google Play Store has been
configured to use the same email address on both phones.  If you have to
change things, you may have to open Cadpage Settings and select
Payment Status > Recalculate Payment Status
to fix things.

If you still do not have the same payment status on both devices,
contact us again, preferrably by using the
Payment Status > I already paid for this
feature on both the old and new phones.

The second problem is that Cadpage generally works by processing text
messages sent from your dispatch center.  And most Android tablets can
not receive text messages.  There are exceptions, and if yours happens
to be one of them, well and good.  Otherwise we have to find a different
way of getting those alerts to Cadpage on your tablet.

The way to do that is to route your dispatch alerts through a paging
service that supports direct paging to Cadpage.  There are three such
services.  CodeMessaging.net and Active911 are both full featured
services that will support your entire department.  Both cost a
reasonable amount of money, and Cadpage is free if you are getting pages
from either one.  If have recently purchased a paid Cadpage subscription
and then decide to switch to either service, you can contact us about
getting that subscription purchase refunded.

The other service is our own, bare bones, no frills, Cadpage paging
service.  This is available at no additional cost, but only if you
really paid for a Cadpage subscription.  And it only supports a single
user.  Like the other services, you have to get dispatch to send your
dispatch alert messages to a specific email address, those alerts will
be forwarded to your device through the mobile data networks.  Since no
text messages are involved in this, the service works on devices that
can not process text messages.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator


****************************************************************
USe Cadpage with Active911

 You can use Cadpage with the Active911 service.  Setup is simple.

Open Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911.com > Unregister > Register
You have to enter the same device activation code you used to Register
the Active911 app.  For you this is ______________

Once you do this, Cadpage will start picking up the Active911 alerts
that used to go to the Active911 app.  The Active911 app will stop
alerting when a call is dispatched.  But if you launch the Active911 app
from Cadpage (we have configurable buttons to make this easier) it will
pull the latest alert information from their servers and display the
latest alerts after a few seconds.

Then you have your department stop sending you the text alerts.

Take care,

********************************************************************
Q: will cadpage work on on straight talk service

A: Cadpage will work on a device plan that allows text messaging.  But the
mapping features, which are the primary reason why people want Cadpage,
require an internet connection.  The Internet connection can be provided
through a local WiFi hotspot if you do not have a carrier data plan.

Take care,

Multiple Versions ! and where's the news ?
posted Jan 14, 2012, 5:14 PM by Derrick Bennett
There are now 2 versions of CadPage on the android market. One is called Cadpage (free) and is just that. Free forever with all the features and abilities that CadPage has had. It will
 continue to receive updates and new locations but will be slightly behind the main version on release dates. The standard version of Cadpage is also in the android market and will continue
  to receive weekly updates including fixes and new locations. This version also has additional functionality of now supporting CodeMessaging.net and Active911.com messaging services. These
services now work with CadPage and do not use SMS for delivering messages.

For the Latest news and headlines please check the facebook page. We update this page as often as we can but the facebook page gets the immediate updates when a new version goes out.

Also for those that keep asking and begging Ken has started working on an IPhone version with some other helpful people. So when that is available we will post more information here.

************************************************************************
SPONSOR - no location

You are using the generic location, which is always a hit or miss
proposition.  There must be something in you dispatch alerts that the
generic location parser is misreading as a dispatch date.

First thing to try is go into Cadpage Location Settings, Select Single
Location, then see if we have a location covering your area.  If there
is, select it and see if that fixes all of your existing alert calls.

If there isn't one, or if it does not fix the existing alerts, long
press all of your existing calls and select "Report Problem" to send
them to us.  We can use that information to write a new location parser
for you.

***************************************************************************

Out of curiosity, just why do you want to set up direct paging apart
from the Active911 service?  Are you getting alerts from some other
department that isn't using Active911?

Direct paging only works when you are getting alerts from a message
servicing agency that supports direct paging.  Active911 is one such
agency, the others are CodeMessaging.net and our own Cadpage paging service.

Setting up direct paging with Active911 or CodeMessaging requires an
activation code that links you to a device configuration that has been
set up by someone in your department.  The Cadpage paging service can
only be used after you purchase a Cadpage subscription.  The usual
sequence of events is to have the dispatch alerts sent to your phone as
text messages and make sure that Cadpage will work with them.  Then,
usually because you are running Android 4.4 and get annoyed because we
can not block the text alerts from showing up in your message inbox, you
can purchase a Cadpage subscription and switch to using the Cadpage
paging service.

No activation code is required to use the Cadpage paging service.  You
just register with the service and it gives you a special dispatch email
address.  You then have your dispatch alerts sent to that address
instead of directly to your phone, and the paging service will forward
them back to Cadpage.  Since these are not text messages, we do not have
problems with them popping up in the message inbox under Android 4.4.

And no, we can not let you try out that service before deciding to pay
for it.  We have to pay a per device charge to the people running the
servers and can not afford to do that for users that are not paying us.

***************************
Pass call through SMS client means:

That tells Cadpage not to block text alerts from getting to your default
message app.  If you check it, dispatch alerts delivered as text
messages will show up in both Cadpage in your message inbox.

It becomes a bit pointless when you run Android 4.4 or higher.  At that
level, we loose the ability to block messsages, so you always get alerts
in Cadpage and in your message regardless of how this is set.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

*************************************************************************
Cadpage stopped working

Cadpage does stop working from time to time.  What happens is dispatch
centers change something about the alerts sent to you and we can no
longer process them.  You need to send us some information on what your
pages look like now and we use that to fix the text parsers that handle
those alerts.  It is not an uncommon occurrence, but it is annoying when
it happens just after the user installs one of our releases, or pays for
a subscription, because it looks like we broke something.

First, or dispatch alerts showing up in your message inbox.  If they are
not, then they are no longer being sent to your phone and you will have
to talk to the IT people in your department to find out why.

Otherwise, wait until the next text pages comes in.  If it still does
not trigger CadPage, then use the Send Email to Developer feature to
send us an email report.  This should include the most recently received
text message, whether or not it was processed by CadPage, which gives us
a lot of information we need to resolve the problem.

If the messages are triggering CADpage, but will not allow you to select
map option: Long press the message to open the Options menu and select
the "Report Problem" menu item.  This will generate an email containing
all of the information we should need to track down the problem with
this message.  You can get the same menu options from the call history
screen by long pressing one of the call entries.

*************************************************************************
Using Cadpage on a tablet

Most tablets can not receive text messages.  Which means Cadpage can not
pick up paging alerts sent as text messages.  The only way you can use
Cadpage on these tablets is to have your dispatch alerts sent to you as
direct pages through a vendor that supports direct paging services.
There are currently 3 such vendors.  CodeMessaging.net, Active911.com,
and our own bare bones Cadpage paging service.

To use our service, you first have to purchase a Cadpage subscription.
Which is unfortunate because we really do not like to require a
subscription purchase until you have some solid assurance that Cadpage
will work.  Unfortunately, the people running the servers charge us when
your device connects to it, so we just can't afford to let people try it
without paying anything.  It might be a good idea if you or some of your
co-workers get Cadpage running on a normal Android phone to make sure
that it works properly before you try getting it running on the tablet.

If you have purchased a subscription, you can start our paging service
by opening Cadpage settings and selecting

    Direct Paging Venders > Cadpage Paging Service > Register

You should shortly receive a registration confirmation popup that will
display your dispatch email address. From there you will have the option
to generate an email requesting that your dispatch alerts be sent to
this address. Then fill in the address of your department IT person and
send it.

Good luck,
***********************************************************************
update on Active911 and Cadpage affiliation

There are a lot of advantages to using Active911.  We used to be their
only Android client, but since they launched their own Android app last
year and started writing their own text parsers we have been drifting apart.

Their service is quite good.  They have an IPhone app which we do not.
For users with an Android phones, you can use their Android app or our
Cadpage app with their service.  The android apps are more or less
equivalent.  The only real advantage of using the Cadpage app is that
you get to see results using Cadpage text parsers instead of Active911
parsers.  There are some page formats where the differences can be
significant, especially when the page format does not do a good job of
clearly separating different data fields.  As luck would have it, your
page format is nicely delimited and Active911 parser results are likely
to be as good you would get using a Cadpage parser.

You should contact them about getting their service set up.  They will
have to set up their own parser duplicating the effort I use to set up a
Cadpage parser.  This is unfortunate, but it the result of business
decisions that we have both made and there is nothing you can do about it.
************************************************************************
Free version download

Ken pulled the free version of Cadpage from the Play Store because too
many users would install it first, and then try to contact us for help
using it.  Only to be told that that version was not supported.  It is
still around and can be installed from our download page at
http://www.cadpage.org/download-cadpage.  You can keep using it as long
as it works for you, but it hasn't been updated for over 2 years and
will not support direct paging vendors.  Which becomes a problem once
you install Android 4.4 and Cadpage can no longer block text alerts from
showing up in your message inbox.
************************************************************************
Using Cadpage with Active911

You can use Cadpage with an Active911 account.  To do this, open Cadpage
Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911 > Register
Then enter the same device activation code that you use to register the
Active911 app.

Once you do this, Active911 alerts will trigger Cadpage but will not
trigger the Active911 app.  If you want to run both apps together, you
can configure a Cadpage button that launches the Active911 app, which
then query the server and display all recent calls.

Now that Android 4.4 has blocked the traditional spam blocker type apps, thanks in no small part to apps like <<<<>>>> abusing the previous spam blocking feature to lock out competitors, would you have any interest in adding an API to your product that would support those kinds of apps with your product.  This shouldn't be too hard to do.  You would require that any third party apps using this feature declare a <<<<>>>> Message blocking permission with a critical warning status to ensure that users no exactly what these apps are capable of.

We publish the Cadpage app, which is not a Spam blocker in the usual sense of the word.  What we do is monitor incoming text messages looking for 911 dispatch alerts sent to members of fire departments and other emergency response organizations.  Cadpage identifies these alerts, parses the necessary information from them and pops up a alert message allowing users to display a map and get directions to the incident location.  That part still works under Android 4.4, what does not work is our ability to keep those alerts from showing up in the regular message inbox where they are redundant.

We are a niche market and do not have a very large user base by your standards.  But implementing a Spam blocking API would let me steer a couple thousand currently unhappy users to your app.

Have a nice day,

Well that is interesting.  And we are about the only app that Norton flags as questionable.  I should feel honored.

Norton is selling mostly smoke and mirrors here.  This isn't Windows where there is no inter-app security to speak of, and their app isn't a rooted system app.  Which means their app doesn't really have access to any other apps and can not do the virus scanning they are trying to sell it as doing.  What they are doing is reading the app permission lists from the package manager and looking for something suspicious.

Their theft prevention feature is useful, but there are better theft prevention apps that are free.  I use Cerberus myself.  And since they are not rooted, they can not turn on fine GPS location tracking if it is not on already.  And most other theft prevention apps take some measures to prevent unauthorized users from finding and disabling or uninstalling them.  Norton does not seem to do any of that.

The permissions requested by Cadpage, and why we need them, are documented at http://www.cadpage.org/faq/permissions.  We do  not access the contact list, we do retrieve your configured email address and phone number to look up your payment subscription status on our authorization server.  We also access the Internet to support direct paging.  A permission scanner finding an app that retrieves your contact name/email/phone number and can potentially send that information to a remote server does have a legitimate reason to raise an alarm.

But you do not need a special app to do that.  You have to approve the app permissions when the app is installed.  Or when any future update requests new permissions.  You can get the current permission list about any app from the application manager.  Just open system settings and select
Application Manager > (app in question)
and scroll down to read the requested permissions.  If you want to see something really alarming, look up the permissions granted to Norton Antivirus.  To be fair, they need to use things like access to the camera and microphone to help you surreptitiously track down a missing phone.  You just have to trust them not to use those capabilities when you do not want them to.

You are registered to receive direct pages from CodeMessaging.  If you are also getting text alerts from someone else, there are a number of reasons why text alerts might be delayed or missed.  For problem with direct pages, open Cadpage Settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Reconnect Direct paging
which usually fixes things.  If it does not, we will need to contact CodeMessaging support and ask them for help.

Have a nice day,
-Ken

Cadpage only works if you are a member of an emergency response
organization and have arranged to have dispatch alerts sent to your phone.

Cadpage will not do anything with the default, out of the box, settings.
You have to give it some information to identify your text pages.

Go into the Cadpage location settings, select a single location, and
then see if we have a location set up for where you happen to live or
work.  If we do, select it and see if things start working.

If not, please let us know if you would like the details of setting up a
new location.

In the meantime, try using the general location setting.  Set the From:
filter to whoever appears in the From: field of your page text messages.
 That will usually give you some degree of functionality while you are
waiting for full location support.

Please contact us again if you still have difficulties.  The best way to
do this is use the Email the Developer item in the main settings menu.

Take care
**************************************************************************

Are dispatch alerts showing up in your message inbox?  If not, then you need to talk to someone in your department about getting dispatch alerts sent to your phone.

If they are, use the Cadpage "Email the Developer" setting to send us a new support email right after Cadpage fails to pick up an alert.  That should include technical information about the missed alert that I need to determine what we have to do to fix things.
**************************************************************************
* Free subscription request using general or null location
* If authorized run days > 10, add 30 day authorization code
**************************************************************************

Apparently, you are using the General location setting.  For a more effective Cadpage experience, we encourage you to select a specific location.

The general location doesn't really know anything about how your text messages are structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them. To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to specify a location setting that will know more about your specific message format and can get a lot more information from it.

To select a specific location, open Cadpage Settings and select
Location Settings > Select Single Location
then navigate to and select a location that corresponds to the location of your dispatch center.

If that works, please send me another request for a free Cadpage subscription, and I will take care of it then.

If there is no supported location for your area, or if the selected location does not work, you can help us set up a new location parser to cover your messages. To do that, long press all of the calls that you currently have in Cadpage call history and select "Report Problem" to send them to us. In exchange for your help setting this up, we will grant you a one-year paid Cadpage subscription.

Take care,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator

************************************************************************
I see that you have selected the General location as well as two specific locations. Please note that the General location does not really know anything about how your text messages are structured and can only pull a limited amount of information from them.

To really get the full benefit of Cadpage you need to ONLY specify the location setting(s) that you use.

Take care,

Do Not Want Cadpage any more

If you do not want to use Cadpage any more, just uninstall it.

If you are still getting text messages notifying you of department
dispatch alerts, you will need to contact that department about stopping
them.  We do not have anything to do with that.

Thanks for trying Cadpage,

* Old Cadpage users - split messages
**************************************************************************
Hi Folks,

We have been reaching out to Cadpage users that we haven't heard from for a while, partly to see how Cadpage is working for you now. And if your department is one of many that have since switched to using Active911, we want to make sure everyone knows that Cadpage can be used with the Active911 service instead of, or in addition to the Android Active911 app. There is no additional charge for using Cadpage in this manner.

We do have some features that the Active911 app still lacks -- more flexible notification options, for example. But the main reason you would probably want to try Cadpage is because we use a different set of message parsers. For most locations, this does not make a lot of difference. But <<<***>>> makes a habit of splitting long alert messages into two or more alerts.   Cadpage can merge these messages back into a single alert.  The Active911 app lacks that capability.

If you are not currently using Cadpage and would like to try it. You can install Cadpage from the Google Play Store.  The first time you open Cadpage it will display a welcome message and give you some options on how you receive dispatch alerts.  You want to select
"My Department Uses Active911"
Next select
"Register with Active911"
This takes to you an Active911 registration page where you need to enter the same Active911 device activation code that you used to register the Active911 app.

Once you do this, Active911 alerts will be picked up by Cadpage and will not be sent to the Active911 app.  If you have any problems with the way Cadpage displays or maps any alert, long press the alert and select "Report Problem" to send it to us.

If you want to continue to use the Active911 app along with Cadpage you can.  Active911 will not trigger when an alert comes in.  But you can configure an "Active911" menu button to show up in the Cadpage main button menu.  When you use that to launch the Active911 app manually, it will query their servers and update the displayed call history after a few seconds.  You need to avoid launching the Active911 app from the launcher window.  It will work properly, but it will also grab the alerts so they no longer go to Cadpage.

If you find you would rather use the Active911 app by itself, just uninstall the Cadpage app and launch the Active911 app.

If the Active911 app has any trouble displaying or mapping any alert, you really should report that to Active911 support.  You can call them at (541) 223-7992 or email support@active911.com.  They will need the Active911 # number and a description of what is wrong.  Getting responders to the correct location is a responsibility that we both take very seriously.  But we can not fix problems if nobody tells us about them.

Have a great day,
-Ken

We do have some features that the Active911 app still lacks -- more flexible notification options, and easier access to turn by turn navigation, for example. And some users like the simpler interface. But the basic functionality will probably be about the same as the Active911 app.

trouble paying through Google

The Google Play Store app handles the Cadpage subscription purchases.
It sounds like the Play Store app has a problem with your Google account.

Open the main system settings and select Google Accounts.  You should
have at least one account listed here and it should report that it was
last synced within the last 24 hours.  If it reports synchronization
problems, there is a good chance that the password for the account has
been changed and no longer matches the one used by your phone.  In which
case you need to fix things and confirm that synchronization is working
properly.

Next, open the Play Store app and open settings.  The account it is
using should be displayed at the top of the settings sidebar.  If you
have multiple accounts, there should be a dropbox that you can use to
select the correct account.

If none of this helps, contact us again and we will fill you in on some
alternate payment methods.
**************************************************************************
Bill AT&T phone carrier

You have to do some setup work, but AT&T has made the process pretty
painless.

Open the Google Play Store App and open settings and select "My
Account".  Under Payment Settings, select
Add Payment Method > Enable AT&T billing

The Play Store app responds by sending a query to AT&T to confirm you
are authorized for this account, then will (hopefully) enable AT&T
carrier billing.  If AT&T rejects the request, then you will have to do
something with AT&T to authorize Google direct billing.  Calling the
AT&T support number (*3 I think) is probably the best way to proceed
with that.

Thanks for your support,
******************************************************************************
why no telephone support service

We have a variable schedule, and with time differences around the country and the world, we find that most of our communications with Cadpage customers can be efficiently conducted via email.


******************************************************************************

Thanks so much for your interest in Cadpage.

We manage an exclusively Android app, at the cost of $9.99 per person per
year.  Payment is generally accomplished through Google Play Store, but
we also take PayPal payments and checks by snail mail.

For a department account, we offer a 30% discount, which brings the
amount down to $7 per person per year.  We would request a list of your
Users, with cell phone numbers, and then invoice your department, by
email if feasible.  For example, for a department with 20 Users, the
cost per year would be $140.

Because we are only for Android phones, we would suggest your
consideration of the messaging services that we are associated with:
CodeMessaging.net and Active911.org.  I am not familiar with the details
of their payment plans, but their websites would be extremely helpful.
If you use CodeMessaging or Active911, there are options for your iPhone
Users.

Your Android Users can still use Cadpage with those messaging services.
 When they register with direct paging, Cadpage is free, since we get
some of the funds from that purchase.

I hope that clarifies the major options available to your department.
Please let me know if you need further information, or would like to
register your department with Cadpage.

Thanks for your consideration,
Jean ~ Cadpage Administrator
*************************************************************************************
* no User email address
*************************************************************************************

Presumably you do have a Google account configured for your device.  But
you have not granted the Cadpage app permission to access your account
information, and without that, we can not identify who you are and
whether or not you have a paid Cadpage subscription.

To grant that permission, open your main Android Settings and select
Apps > Cadpage > App Permissions
and enable the "Contacts" permission.

After that, you can open Cadpage settings and select
Payment Status > I already paid for this

That generates a new support email to us, which hopefully will now
contain your email account, which Jean will use to set up your subscription.

Thank you for your support,

Cadpage with Active911 - advantages

If your department goes with Active911, they will tell you how install
and use the Active911 app for Android phones.  What they don't tell you
is that you can register Cadpage with the Active911 service and use
Cadpage instead of their Active911 app.  If you do that, Active911 pays
us some of the money they get from your department, so Cadpage becomes a
free sponsored product.

Cadpage will continue to work as it always has.  You do gain the ability
to report your response status to the Active911 servers.  And an
additional button appears that will display the call information that
Active911 has, including overall responder status.

There are some features of the Active911 app that Cadpage can not duplicate
1) It has a map display showing current responder positions.
2) It allows easy access to your Active911 profile settings.

And Cadpage has some features that the Active911 app does not, primarily
more flexible notification options.

Cadpage uses different message parsers that Active911 does.  For most
locations, this doesn't make a whole lot of difference.  But there are a
fair number of locations where we do a much better job of extracting
information from the dispatch alerts.

If you want to use Cadpage with Active911, open Cadpage settings and select
Direct Paging Vendors > Active911 > Register
and enter the activation code that you will soon get from your department.

**************************************************************************************
Ack button

Cadpage displays the 'Ack' button when it things something about your
notification settings requires that the alert be cleared before
proceeding.  If you had Cadpage configured to play a loud alert
continuously, for example, it would make sense that you should do
something to silence the alert before looking at your other options.

* Inactive Active911 account - Current user paid subscription
**************************************************************************************

This is interesting..

You are registered with an Active911 account, which is current paid up. But you do not appear to be using it. The last direct page you received from Active911 was back last October or later, which lead Cadpage to suspect the Active911 account was no longer active.

Clearly Cadpage should be reporting a Sponsored status. This will be fixed in the next Cadpage release which should be out later today.

But it does make me wonder why you appear to be paying for an Active911 subscription that you are not using.

Thanks for contacting us,

* Inactive Active911 account - no subscription - Agency status:paid
**************************************************************************************

You do have Cadpage registered with Active911, but it appears that the Active911 account you registered with is no longer active. Which means nobody is paying for it, which means Active911 isn't paying us.

If you think this is incorrect, let us know and we can contact Active911 support to make sure we are reading your status information correctly.

Since you are not using Cadpage to process Active911 alerts, Active911
does not pay us anything.

You can restore the sponsored payment status by re-registering Cadpage
with Active911. This will result in your dispatch alerts being sent to

* Support app install instructions - Android 9 with Chrome
**************************************************************************************
Sorry you are having trouble installing the message support app.

Unfortunately detailed instructions vary depending on on what version of Android you are running and which web browser you are using.  This is what works for Android 9 using the Chrome web browser.

1) Open Cadpage it should display a warning that you need to install the Cadpage message support app.
2) Select "Install Cadpage support app".
3) This takes you to a web page with detailed instructions on how to download and install the support app. Click on the cadpage-support.apk link
4) If Chrome asks for permission to access your files, grant it
5) Select "Download" to download the cadpage-support.apk file.
6) Chrome displays a warning that this type of file can harm your device.  Select "OK".
7) Once the support app is downloaded, select "Open"
8) Next you will probably see a warning that your phone is not allowed to install unknown apps from this source.  Select "Settings".
9) Turn on the "Allow from this Source" setting and press the back key
10) Now you will be asked if you want to install the Cadpage Msg Support app.  Select "Install".
11) Once the app is installed, select "Open"
12) The first thing that happens when you open the support app is that it will ask you to allow it to send and view SMS messages.  Select "Allow".
13) Cadpage should open and function normally.

But!!! We had to enable the install apps from an unknown source option, which can be dangerous.  You are strongly advised to go through some extra steps to turn that off.
1) Open your Android system settings
2) Select "Apps & Notifications"
3) Select "Chrome"
4) Select "Advanced"
5) Select "Install unknown apps"
6) Turn off the "Allow from this source" option

If you run into trouble at any point, get a screen capture by long pressing the power button and selecting "Screen Capture".  Then send that to us.

Sorry that this is all so complicated.  I keep trying to get Google to consider allowing Cadpage to "officially" process text messages on it's own, but I have not been able to get through the process to get considered by a real human :(

Good luck,
-Ken

**************************************************************************************
* Help needed - nothing set up
**************************************************************************************

Thanks for trying out Cadpage.

Cadpage only works if you are a member of a department that is sending dispatch alerts to your phone, typically as text messages.  Are your department's alerts current showing up in your message app?  If not, then you need to talk to someone in your department about getting their alerts sent to your phone.

If you are receiving those alerts, then you need to tell Cadpage to process them.

When you open the Cadpage app, it should display a "Welcome to Cadpage" screen and warn you that nothing will happen with your current settings.

Assuming that you are receiving text alerts, select
My department sends me text alerts

That takes you to the "Text dispatch alerts" screen.  Select
Enable Cadpage text message processing

This should take you to the "Install Cadpage Message support screen which warns you that Cadpage is no longer allowed to process incoming text messages and that you must install an auxiliary support app  to allow this functionality.  Select
Install Cadpage support app

This takes you to a web page with instructions on how to download and install the support app.  You need to click on the "cadpage-support.apk" link and follow the directions from there.

Once the support app is installed, running it or the Cadpage will take you back to the "Welcome to Cadpage" welcome screen.  Select
My department sends me text alerts

Which takes you to the "Text dispatch alerts" screen again.  But now you can select
Select the appropriate location
then navigate to and select your current location.  This is necessary so Cadpage will know what your dispatch alert messages should look like.

And finally you get to the final "Cadpage is good to go!' screen.  Just select "Done" and Cadpage should be ready to go.

Cadpage should start working normally.  If it does not, or if you have any further problems, use the "Email the Developer" setting in "General Settings" to send us a new support email.

Good luck,
-Ken

**************************************************************************************
* MMS not working
**************************************************************************************

So, you turn out to be one of three users who are reporting problems with the problematic MMS message processing logic that Cadpage has been using.  Just in time for me to roll out the new improved MMS processing logic that will no longer require the services of the real message app to access the MMS message content.  I just published a beta version of Cadpage with the new logic.  It should be available in a couple hours.

First, you have make sure that you are a Cadpage beta tester.  To do that, open the Google Play Store app and select the Cadpage page.  Toward the bottom of the screen, there should a "Join the Beta".  Click the "Join" button, then back out of the Cadpage page and reselect it.  You should now tell you that you are a beta tester and the new Cadpage beta version should be available to install.

There will be new "Use old MMS Content Download Logic" setting in the Cadpage location settings.  It defaults to on for existing Cadpage users and off for new users on the theory that most existing users are happy with the way Cadpage processing MMS messages and don't want to be bothered with upgrading the message support app.  But you are not satisfied with the existing MMS processing logic, so you should turn the "Use old MMS content download logic" setting off.

As soon as you do this, Cadpage will warn you that you need to upgrade the message support app.  Select the "Install Support app" button, then click on one of the cadpage-support.apk buttons and follow the directions to download and install the new support app.

That should do it.  If you still have problems with Cadpage picking up the dispatch alerts, use the "Email the Developer" setting to send us another support email.

Good luck,
-Ken

* Cadpage registration with Active911 no longer works
**************************************************************************************

Active911 should have this fixed in a day or so.  Until there, there is a workaround

1) Ask Cadpage to register with Active911
2) When you get the 404 error, click on the web link at the top of the screen.
3) This should display your page history.  The first line will read "Error".  Click the pencil icon at the far right of that line
4) This will make the web link at the top of the screen editable.  You have to drag the cursor from to the beginning of the very long URL and change the initial "www" to "console"
5) Send that, then continue the regular registration process.

* Hey Google!!
**************************************************************************************
To assist firefighters and other emergency responders in navigating to the scene of an emergency 911 alert.  As a secondary feature, one dispatch service would like to display a map of current responder locations to assist fireground officers in managing the incident scene.  Cadpage supports this by reporting the current location to this dispatch service.  There are multiple safeguards to ensure that the user is aware that this is happening and can turn if off if desired.

In normal operation, a user receive an alert, then press a button that launches the Google map app to provide navigation directions to the incident scene.  While the user is very aware that Cadpage is operating and most believe that Cadpage is provding the navigation directions, the fact that the map app is running in the foreground relegates Cadpage to a background status.  Without current background location access, it will be unable to provide the dispatch service with accurate location data.
